## Distr v1.2 is Here!

It hasn't been long since we last came knocking into your inbox, but we've been all ears, soaking in the fantastic feedback many of you shared. We're excited to introduce a highly requested feature in the latest minor version of Distr.

## What's New: License Management (Beta)

We are rolling out the beta version of vendor application licensing on the portal. Initially rolling the feature out to users who specifically asked for it, but if you're interested, just let us know, and we'll unlock it for you.

### Why it matters

Software vendors need a way to manage the versions of software their customers have access to. Most software vendors offer different pricing plans, delivering different features and differing levels of functionality. Vendors serving end-customers in self-managed environments need the granularity to be able to grant or remove access to applications at the version level and that what we have delivered in the first beta version on the licensing feature.

### How to use it

If you don't see the feature yet, reach out, and we'll enable it for you. Once you're in, here's how it works:

1.  **Create a Customer**
2.  **Create a License**
3.  **Give It a Name**
4.  **Set an Expiration Date**
5.  **Assign to an Application:** Choose the relevant application version/s.
6.  **Link to the Customer**
7.  **Save:** Hit "Save," and you're done!

The customer can now access and deploy the assigned application version/s directly from their customer portal.

> Docker registry authentication: If your application artifacts are stored in a private OCI registry, you can use the license as the authentication method to grant customer access. In the license configuration panel add the credentials needed to unlock the specified application versions.
