Software developers nowadays have a lot of options when choosing a container registry to upload containers to their infrastructure or share the artifacts with customers.

But not all OCI registries serve the same purpose.
Some are designed primarily for **internal use**—filling the gap between developers, CI/CD pipelines, and deployment within a single organization.
Others are built for **external distribution**—helping software vendors distribute artifacts to customers,
often across security boundaries or into [air-gapped](/glossary/air-gapped-meaning/) environments.

In this post, we'll compare different registry options, focusing on how each supports real-world software distribution needs.

But first, let's define a few key terms.

## Terminology

- **[Registry](/glossary/oci-container-artifact-registry/)**: A service for storing and distributing container artifacts.
  Examples include private Docker image registries, OCI registries, and many proprietary registries which will be covered below.
- **[Artifact](/glossary/oci-container-artifact-registry/)**: Can have multiple meanings, but in this context it refers to an OCI-compliant image.
- **[Container Image](/glossary/oci-container-artifact-registry/)**: A type of artifact. It consists of manifests and blobs.
- **[Digest](/glossary/oci-container-artifact-registry/)**: A unique identifier for a specific version of an artifact, typically a SHA256 hash. The digest cannot change.
- **[Tag](/glossary/oci-container-artifact-registry/)**: A human-readable label for a specific version of an artifact, often used for versioning (e.g., `latest`, `v1.0`, etc.).
  It points to a unique digest.
  If tags in a registry are immutable, it is not possible to change the pointer to another digest.
- **[Manifest](/glossary/oci-container-artifact-registry/)**: Metadata that defines how blobs are combined to form a container image.
  It can also reference other manifests in the case of a multi-arch image.
- **[Blob](/glossary/oci-container-artifact-registry/)**: The actual data of an artifact, most commonly an archive of files.
- **[SBOM (Software Bill of Materials)](/glossary/sbom-software-bill-of-materials/)**: A list of components and dependencies used in a software build. It is most common to directly add it as a layer to the OCI image.
- **[Image Signing](/glossary/oci-container-artifact-registry/#image-signing-and-verification)**: A cryptographic process that ensures the integrity and authenticity of container images. The signature can also be directly integrated into the OCI image.
- **[OCI Compliance](/glossary/oci-container-artifact-registry/)**: Adherence to the Open Container Initiative standards, ensuring OCI-compliant containers can be used across different platforms.

## What Is a Container Registry?

A [container registry](/glossary/oci-container-artifact-registry/) is used by software developers as a service to store, manage, and distribute container images and related OCI-compliant artifacts.
It provides APIs for pushing and pulling artifacts and is mostly consumed by CLI clients in CI/CD environments or deployment targets.
Mature container registries come with advanced access control, analytics, and user interfaces.

For a deeper understanding of how container registries work, including the difference between registries and repositories, see our [complete container registry guide](/glossary/oci-container-artifact-registry/).

## Understanding the OCI Format

[OCI (Open Container Initiative) compliance](/glossary/oci-container-artifact-registry/#oci-container-registry-what-is-oci-compliance) ensures container images and artifacts work consistently across different platforms and tools. The OCI standardizes image formats, distribution methods, and runtime specifications, bringing portability and preventing vendor lock-in.

Popular tools like Helm, Docker, and [ORAS](https://oras.land/) support pushing and pulling OCI-compliant artifacts.
A growing trend is using ORAS to package and store non-OCI-native formats, like Kubeflow pipelines, configuration bundles, or machine learning models, as OCI artifacts.

For example, you can push a machine learning model like this:

```shell
oras push registry.distr.sh/my-org/ml-model:0.0.1 ./model.pkl:application/vnd.myorg.model
```

For a comprehensive explanation of OCI specifications, compliance requirements, and conformance testing, see our [complete guide to OCI container registries](/glossary/oci-container-artifact-registry/#oci-container-registry-what-is-oci-compliance).

## Key Considerations When Choosing a Registry

When evaluating registries, consider these core criteria:

**Internal vs. External Use**
Is this for your internal development team's workflow, or for distributing to customers?
This is the most fundamental distinction.

**OCI Compliance Level**
How completely does the registry implement the [OCI specification](/glossary/oci-container-artifact-registry/#oci-container-registry-what-is-oci-compliance)?
This affects which artifact types you can store and distribute.

**Security & Access Controls**
For internal use, integration with your existing IAM may be sufficient.
For external distribution, you'll need granular controls over which artifacts are visible to which customers.
[Vulnerability scanning](/glossary/vulnerability-scanning/) and [image signing](/glossary/oci-container-artifact-registry/#image-signing-and-verification) are also important considerations. See our [container registry security best practices](/glossary/oci-container-artifact-registry/#container-registry-security-best-practices) guide for more details.

**Deployment Flexibility**
Can the registry be deployed where you need it—cloud, [on-premises](/glossary/on-premises-definition/), or [air-gapped](/glossary/air-gapped-meaning/) environments?
For more on registry deployment options, see our [container registry use cases](/glossary/oci-container-artifact-registry/#container-registry-use-cases) guide.

**Support**
Does the registry have a strong support community or a commercial vendor backing?

## List of private (internal) container registries

Internal registries are for the most part built for trusted, in-house use.
They integrate tightly with cloud services, IAM systems, and CI/CD pipelines to support internal teams.

They're ideal when dev and deploy happen inside the same security boundary, with no need to serve external customers.

But they often come with limited user interfaces, access control options, and analytics.

## List of container registries that support external users

External registries face a fundamentally different challenge: distributing software to end customers, usually outside of your organization. That shift requires a different focus: access control, auditing, version visibility, and compliance. For more on the unique challenges of customer-facing container registries, see our [guide to container registries for software distribution](/glossary/oci-container-artifact-registry/#container-registry-for-software-distribution-to-customers).

While GitHub Container Registry and Docker Hub are excellent for open-source and low-security use cases, they're not well suited for commercial software distribution because they lack:

- **Granular access control**: No way to give specific customers access to specific artifact versions
- **[Air-gapped](/glossary/air-gapped-meaning/) support**: Limited options for distributing to high-security environments
- **Usage visibility**: Missing audit logs and download tracking that commercial vendors need
- **License management**: No built-in capabilities to manage software entitlements

This is where purpose-built external registries like Distr come in, addressing these gaps for vendor-to-customer distribution.

### Distr

![Distr OCI registry](../../assets/blog/2025-04-07-registry-comparison/distr-cr.png)

[Distr](/) comes with an OCI-compliant [artifact registry](/docs/product/registry/) natively built into the platform.

Distr itself is [fully open source on GitHub](https://github.com/distr-sh/distr/) and can be self-hosted.
It not only features a [vendor portal](/docs/product/vendor-portal/) that allows software and AI companies to manage their artifacts,
invite end customers, and manage their licenses and access policies to specific tags of an image or version of an application.

It also comes with a [customer portal](/docs/product/customer-portal/) where end customers see all available artifacts and can create access tokens to interact with the registry.

**Key features:**

- Offers a vendor and customer portal
- Supports OCI-formatted and OCI-compliant artifacts (Helm, Docker, etc)
- Built specifically for commercial self-managed deployment options for software and AI companies.
- Advanced features: artifact tag restrictions, usage tracking, and granular access controls
- It can be consumed as a managed service (SaaS).
  (Sign up at [Get Started](/get-started/)) or [self-managed](/docs/self-hosting/getting-started/).
- Open Source and free to use

**Who it's for:**

## Conclusion: Which container registry fits your needs best?

- **For enterprises that use artifacts internally**:
  Choose **JFrog Artifactory** or **Harbor** for large organizations managing complex internal workflows.
  Both offer robust access controls, multi-format support, and policy enforcement for secure, large-scale internal use.
- **SaaS vendors that only host at one cloud provider without self-managed support**:
  If your infrastructure runs in a specific cloud, consider the container registry your cloud provider offers.
- **Non-commercial open source projects**:
  **GitHub Container Registry** and **Docker Hub** are ideal for distributing public artifacts to a wide audience with minimal setup.
  They're straightforward to adopt, work well with standard dev tooling, and are commonly known.
- **Commercial open source projects and SaaS vendors that want to offer self-managed deployment options**:
  **[Distr](/)** is built for software vendors distributing artifacts to external customer environments, including regulated, self-managed, or air-gapped deployments.
  It offers granular access controls, usage tracking, and flexible deployment models that internal or public registries can't deliver.
