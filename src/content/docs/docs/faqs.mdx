<details>
  <summary>Can I customize the Distr platform for my brand?</summary>
  <p>
    Yes, Distr can be white-labeled with your branding, providing a consistent
    experience for your customers and making the platform appear as an extension
    of your product suite.

<details>
  <summary>Can I toggle between Vendor and Customer portal?</summary>
  <p>
    {' '}
    No, there is no way to toggle between the Vendor and Customer views. If a
    vendor wants to manage their own deployments, they can do so using the
    Deployments tab within the Vendor Portal. The Customer Portal is only
    accessible to end-customers who have been onboarded by a software vendor.
    After onboarding, the customer will receive an email to set their
    credentials. Once the credentials are set, the end-customer can access the
    Customer Portal.{' '}

  <summary>
    Can I simulate a target environment on a MacOS machine for testing purposes?
  </summary>
  <p>
    {' '}
    Yes, definitely. If you want to simulate a target environment by running a
    container hosting emulator like [Docker
    Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) on your macOS
    machine, check out this [short guide](/docs/guides/distr-on-macos/). It
    covers the configuration steps needed to ensure Distr can communicate with
    the Docker daemon.{' '}
