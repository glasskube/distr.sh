While the easiest way to use Distr is to use our [hosted version](https://signup.distr.sh/).
Distr is written in the Go programming language with minimal dependencies on a Postgres Database
and optional S3 compatible object storage if you want to use Distr artifacts registry.

Find out more information about the inner workings of Distr at [`github.com/glasskube/distr`](https://github.com/glasskube/distr/).

Or checkout or [Docker Compose](/docs/self-hosting/docker) or [Kubernetes](/docs/self-hosting/kubernetes) deployment options.

## Semantic Versioning

We are using [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) for the releases of Distr Hub, Distr Agents and Distr SDKs.

## Enterprise Support

We also offer enterprise support for self-hosting Distr in your own environment.
