While the easiest way to use Distr is to use our hosted version, it is also very easy to host your own instance of the Distr Hub.
Distr is distributed as an OCI compatible container image.
Additionally, we also provide some batteries-included deployment examples to help you get started as quickly as possible.

## Semantic Versioning

We are using [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) for the releases of Distr Hub, Distr Agents and Distr SDKs.
