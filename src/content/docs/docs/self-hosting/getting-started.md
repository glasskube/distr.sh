While the easiest way to use Distr is to use our [hosted version](/get-started/), Distr is written in the Go programming language with minimal dependencies on a Postgres Database and optional S3 compatible object storage if you want to use Distr artifacts registry.

Find out more information about the inner workings of Distr at [`github.com/glasskube/distr`](https://github.com/glasskube/distr/).

Or checkout or [Docker Compose](/docs/self-hosting/docker/) or [Kubernetes](/docs/self-hosting/kubernetes/) deployment options.

## Semantic Versioning
