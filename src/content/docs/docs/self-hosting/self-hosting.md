While the easiest way to use distr.sh is to use our hosted version, it is also very easy to host your own instance of the distr.sh Hub.
distr.sh is distributed as an OCI compatible container image.
Additionally, we also provide some batteries-included deployment examples to help you get started as quickly as possible.
