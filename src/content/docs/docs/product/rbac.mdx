Distr provides role-based access control (RBAC) to help you manage who can access and modify different parts of your organization. Understanding roles and permissions is essential for maintaining security and proper access control across your vendor organization and customer organizations.

<Aside type="note">
  Role-based access control is available in Pro, Enterprise, and Pro Trial
  plans. The Starter plan only allows one user per customer who will
  automatically have Administrator privileges. All internal users have
  Administrator privileges as well.
</Aside>

## Overview of User Roles

Distr uses a role-based permission system with three standard roles that apply to both vendor organizations (your team) and customer organizations (your end customers):

- **Administrator** - Full access to all features and settings
- **User** - Can view and modify most resources, but cannot manage users or organization settings
- **Viewer** - Can view resources but cannot make changes

## Roles and Permissions Matrix

  organization, but vendor administrators have full visibility and control over
  all customer organizations.

## How to Invite Users with Specific Roles

### Inviting Vendor Organization Users

To add team members to your vendor organization:

1. Log in to the [Vendor Portal](https://app.distr.sh)
2. Navigate to the **Users** section in the sidebar
3. Click **Add User** in the top right corner
4. Enter the user's name, email address and select the role.
5. Click **Submit**

The invited user will receive an email with a link to set up their account and password. Once they complete registration, they'll have access according to their assigned role.

<Aside type="note">
  In Starter plans, all users are automatically assigned the Administrator role,
  and the role selection dropdown is not available.

## How Roles Differ Between Plans

### Starter Plan

**Role Management:** Not available

- All internal users automatically have **Administrator** privileges
- No role selection when inviting users
- All team members have full access to all features
- Customer organizations can only have one user.

**Use case:** Ideal for small teams or POCs where simplified access control is sufficient.

<Aside type="caution">
  If you upgrade from Starter to Pro, existing users will automatically be
  assigned the Administrator role. You can then change their roles as needed.
</Aside>

### Pro Plan

**Role Management:** Full RBAC available

- Three roles available: **Administrator**, **User**, **Viewer**
- Role selection available when inviting users
- Can assign different roles to different team members (internal users)
- Internal users can have granular permissions based on their role
- Customer organizations can also use role-based access
- Multiple customer users per organization with role-based permissions
- Supports SSO integration for enhanced security
- Full control over who can view, edit, or manage different parts of the platform

**Use case:** Ideal for teams that need granular access control and security compliance. Perfect for organizations where different team members need different levels of access to applications, deployments, licenses, and customer management.

### Enterprise Plan

**Role Management:** Advanced RBAC with custom roles

- All Pro plan roles available
- **Custom roles** can be created with specific permission sets
- Custom workflows and permission combinations
- Advanced SSO and identity provider integrations
- Fine-grained access control for complex organizational structures

**Use case:** Ideal for large enterprises with complex access requirements and compliance needs.

## Managing User Roles

Administrators can edit or remove any user by locating the user, selecting a new role to update their access, or clicking the delete button to remove them entirely.
