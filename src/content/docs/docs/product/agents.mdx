Deployment Agents are a core component of the Distr platform, designed to run within customer environments alongside vendor applications. These lightweight agents bridge the gap between the Distr Hub and deployment targets, enabling comprehensive lifecycle management requiring minimal access to customer infrastructure.

<Aside type="note">
  Distr deployment agents are the key components that enable the [Assisted
  Self-Managed Customer](/docs/use-cases/assisted-self-managed/) and
  [BYOC](/docs/use-cases/byoc/) use cases.
</Aside>

## Agent Types

Distr offers specialized agents for different deployment tools, each designed to handle specific deployment scenarios while maintaining consistent core functionality.

### Docker Compose Agent

The Docker Compose agent is specifically designed for container-based deployments, providing comprehensive management of both single and multi-container applications. It handles application updates with minimal downtime, collects container health metrics and logs, and supports environment variable templating for flexible configuration.

<Aside type="note">
  Unless you're using Distr to deploy your own applications internally, the
  Distr agent will always be configured and deployed by the end customer. Head
  over to the [end-customer agent
  guide](/docs/guides/end-customer-registry-view/#deployment-agent-quickstart-from-the-customer-portal)
  to learn how it should be installed.
</Aside>

#### Configuration Steps

1. Navigate to the Deployments panel in the Agents section
2. Click "+ Add deployment"
3. Provide a deployment name
4. Install the agent
5. Select the application and version to deploy
6. Configure environment variables
7. Deploy the application
8. Monitor deployment status

### Helm Agent

The Helm agent specializes in Kubernetes deployments, managing the complete lifecycle of Helm charts in customer environments. It handles chart installation and upgrades, monitors Kubernetes resource health, supports customer-specific value overrides, and provides rollback capabilities for failed deployments.

  alt="Helm Agent interface"
/>

#### Configuration Steps

1. Access the Deployments panel in the Agents section
2. Create a new deployment
3. Install the Helm agent
4. Select the target application and version
5. Configure Helm values
6. Deploy and monitor the application

### Terraform Agent (Coming Soon)

<Aside type="note">
  Our upcoming Terraform agent will unlock powerful infrastructure-as-code
  capabilities, particularly for Bring Your Own Cloud (BYOC) scenarios.
</Aside>

The Terraform agent will revolutionize infrastructure management by enabling the deployment of complete environments using Terraform modules stored in the Distr Registry. This agent will manage both infrastructure and applications, handle customer-specific cloud resource variables, and maintain infrastructure state tracking and versioning.

This agent will be particularly valuable for fully managed deployments where vendors need to provision and configure the underlying infrastructure before deploying their applications.

## Section Components

The Deployment Agents section of Distr consists of two main components that work together to provide a complete deployment management solution.

### Applications

  darkSrc="/src/assets/docs/product/deployment-agents/agent-applications-dark.png"
  alt="Applications interface"
/>

The Applications section provides vendors with a dedicated space to configure and manage their software offerings. Using either Docker Compose files or Helm charts, vendors can define their application templates, specify which environment variables are configurable by customers, and manage different versions of their applications. This section serves as the foundation for all subsequent deployment activities.

For detailed instructions on adding applications to Distr, see our platform management guides:

- [Onboarding a Docker Application](/docs/guides/platform-management/onboarding-a-docker-app/)
- [Onboarding a Helm Application](/docs/guides/platform-management/onboarding-a-helm-app/)

### Deployments

### Deployments Overview

The **Deployments** section acts as the central management and health dashboard for both vendor-managed and customer-controlled deployments.

Use this section to:

- Monitor the real-time health and status of all deployments
- View deployment metadata and logs
- Track application states across all customer environments

### Color-Coded Health Status

Deployment health is indicated using color-coded status badges:

- **ðŸ”´ Error (Red)**  
  The deployed application has failed to deploy successfully. Error logs are available, and remediation is required.  
  âž¤ _New deployments cannot be created until the error state is resolved._

- **ðŸŸ¡ Stale (Yellow)**  
  The agent has not made a `resource` request to Distr Hub within the last 60 seconds.  
  âž¤ _This indicates a communication issue. No new deployments can be made until the agent is healthy._

- **ðŸŸ¢ OK (Green)**  
  The agent is actively communicating with Distr Hub and reporting a healthy application state.  
  âž¤ _New deployments are allowed. The **+ Deployment** button will be visible._

## Agent Capabilities

All Distr agents share a common set of core capabilities designed to ensure reliable and secure deployments. These include guided installation processes, automated application updates, comprehensive health monitoring, log aggregation for troubleshooting, and secure, outbound-only communication with the Distr Hub.

<Aside>
  We are also developing an embeddable agent SDK that can be integrated directly
  into vendor applications, providing a more seamless deployment experience with
  minimal additional components. For more information, feel free to reach out.
