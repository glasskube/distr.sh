title: Deployment Agents
description: Distr deployment agents are lightweight components that run in customer environments to manage the full lifecycle of infrastructure and applications. This page covers how Docker, Helm, and Terraform agents work, how to configure them, and how they enable secure, customer-controlled deployments.

Deployment Agents are a core component of the Distr platform, designed to run within customer environments alongside vendor applications. These lightweight agents bridge the gap between the Distr Hub and deployment targets, enabling comprehensive lifecycle management requiring minimal access to customer infrastructure.

<Aside type="note">
  Distr deployment agents are the key components that enable the [Assisted
  Self-Managed Customer](/docs/use-cases/assisted-self-managed/) and
  [BYOC](/docs/use-cases/byoc-bring-your-own-cloud/) use cases.

## Agent Types

Distr offers specialized agents for different deployment tools, each designed to handle specific deployment scenarios while maintaining consistent core functionality.

### Docker Compose Agent

The Docker Compose agent is specifically designed for container-based deployments, providing comprehensive management of both single and multi-container applications. It handles application updates with minimal downtime, collects container health metrics and logs, and supports environment variable templating for flexible configuration.

<Aside type="note">
  Unless you're using Distr to deploy your own applications internally, the
  Distr agent will always be configured and deployed by the end customer. Head
  over to the [end-customer agent
  guide](/docs/guides/container-registry-for-end-customers/#deployment-agent-quickstart-from-the-customer-portal)
  to learn how it should be installed.
</Aside>

### Helm Agent

The Helm agent specializes in Kubernetes deployments, managing the complete lifecycle of Helm charts in customer environments. It handles chart installation and upgrades, monitors Kubernetes resource health, supports customer-specific value overrides, and provides rollback capabilities for failed deployments.

### Terraform Agent (Coming Soon)

<Aside type="caution" title="Currently in development">
  The Terraform agent is designed for Bring Your Own Cloud (BYOC) deployments
  and is currently in development.

#### Configuration Steps

Follow the configuration steps in the [Deployment Agent Quickstart Guide](/docs/guides/container-registry-for-end-customers/#deployment-agent-quickstart-from-the-customer-portal).

## Section Components

The Deployment Agents section of Distr consists of two main components that work together to provide a complete deployment management solution.

### Applications

<ThemedImage
  lightSrc={agentApplicationsLight}
  darkSrc={agentApplicationsDark}
  alt="Applications interface"
/>

The Applications section provides vendors with a dedicated space to configure and manage their software offerings. Using either Docker Compose files or Helm charts, vendors can define their application templates, specify which environment variables are configurable by customers, and manage different versions of their applications. This section serves as the foundation for all subsequent deployment activities.

For detailed instructions on adding applications to Distr, see our platform management guides:

- [Onboarding a Docker Application](/docs/guides/onboarding-a-docker-app/)
- [Onboarding a Helm Application](/docs/guides/onboarding-a-helm-app/)

### Deployments

<ThemedImage

### Deployments Overview

The **Deployments** section acts as the central management and health dashboard for all deployments.

Use this section to:

- Monitor the real-time health and status of all deployments
- View deployment metadata and logs
- Track deployment states across all customer environments

## Deployment Health

The Deployments page shows status information on both deployment target and deployment level.

The Distr agent, which is deployed once per deployment target, reconciles the state of the deployment target every 5 seconds,
thereby also reporting the health of the deployment target and the contained deployments.

### Deployment Target status list

- âš« **Not connected**: the dot to the left of the deployment target name is grey.
- ðŸŸ¢ **Connected**: the dot is green.
- ðŸŸ¡ **Stale**, i.e. the agent has been connected before but did not report its health in the last 60 seconds:
  the dot is yellow.
  Only in this case, you can Reconnect the agent by creating new credentials for the agent.
  Please note that this will invalidate the previous credentials.

### Deployment Status list

- âš« **No status**: The agent did not report anything regarding the deployment yet.
- ðŸ”´ **Error**: There is an error regarding the deployment.
  Consider investing the errors via the Status logs.
- ðŸŸ¡ **Stale**: The agent has not reported the deployment health in the last 60 seconds.
- ðŸ”µ **Progressing**: The agent is currently installing or upgrading the deployment, due to your previous request.
- ðŸŸ¢ **OK**: The deployment is healthy and running.

## Agent Capabilities

All Distr agents share a common set of core capabilities designed to ensure reliable and secure deployments. These include guided installation processes, automated application updates, comprehensive health monitoring, log aggregation for troubleshooting, and secure, outbound-only communication with the Distr Hub.

<Aside>
  We also working on read-only version of the Distr agent that will not be able
  to alter a deployment, but just monitor the deployment status and report logs
  and metrics.
