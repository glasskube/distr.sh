Deployment Agents are a core component of the Distr platform, designed to run within customer environments alongside vendor applications. These lightweight agents bridge the gap between the Distr Hub and deployment targets, enabling comprehensive lifecycle management requiring minimal access to customer infrastructure.

  Distr deployment agents are the key components that enable the [Assisted

## Agent Types

Distr offers specialized agents for different deployment tools, each designed to handle specific deployment scenarios while maintaining consistent core functionality.

### Docker Compose Agent

The Docker Compose agent is specifically designed for container-based deployments, providing comprehensive management of both single and multi-container applications. It handles application updates with minimal downtime, collects container health metrics and logs, and supports environment variable templating for flexible configuration.

<Aside type="note">
  Unless you're using Distr to deploy your own applications internally, the
  Distr agent will always be configured and deployed by the end customer. Head
  over to the [end-customer agent
  guide](/docs/guides/container-registry-for-end-customers/#deployment-agent-quickstart-from-the-customer-portal)
  to learn how it should be installed.
</Aside>

#### Technical Details

In the following we want to dive deep into how the docker compose agent works.

##### Requirements

The host system must have Docker and Docker Compose installed.

##### Installation and Environment

The installation of the agent is done by the end customer (or the vendor, if it should be vendor managed) by fetching
a docker compose file and starting it with `docker compose up`.
This is why the installation command looks like this:
`curl "https://<distr-hub>/api/v1/connect?targetId=<targetId>&targetSecret=<targetSecret>" | docker compose -f - up -d`,
where `<distr-hub>` is the hostname of the Distr Hub, `<targetId>` is the ID of the deployment target, and `<targetSecret>` is the secret of the deployment target.

The authentication via Target ID and secret ensure that the agent can only fetch the deployments of one specific deployment target.
Although the secret is generated by the Distr Hub, it is only shown once to the user. The Distr Hub does not store the secret, but can verify it.

Let's have a closer look at the docker compose file for running the agent:

```yaml
name: distr
services:
  agent:
    network_mode: host
    restart: unless-stopped
    image: 'ghcr.io/glasskube/distr/docker-agent:v1.8.1'
    environment:
      # Authentication with Distr Hub, see above
      DISTR_TARGET_ID: '<targetId>'
      DISTR_TARGET_SECRET: '<targetSecret>'
      # various enpoints of the Distr Hub:
      DISTR_LOGIN_ENDPOINT: 'https://<distr-hub>/api/v1/agent/login'
      DISTR_MANIFEST_ENDPOINT: 'https://<distr-hub>/api/v1/agent/manifest'
      DISTR_RESOURCE_ENDPOINT: 'https://<distr-hub>/api/v1/agent/resources'
      DISTR_STATUS_ENDPOINT: 'https://<distr-hub>/api/v1/agent/status'
      DISTR_METRICS_ENDPOINT: 'https://<distr-hub>/api/v1/agent/metrics'
      # how often the agent fetches deployments
      DISTR_INTERVAL: '5s'
      # agent versioning information, needed for agent self-updates:
      DISTR_AGENT_VERSION_ID: '<db-id-of-agent-version>'
      DISTR_AGENT_SCRATCH_DIR: /scratch
      DISTR_REGISTRY_HOST: 'localhost:8585'
      HOST_DOCKER_CONFIG_DIR: ${HOST_DOCKER_CONFIG_DIR-${HOME}/.docker}
    volumes:
      # the host's docker socket is mounted into the agent container
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
      - scratch:/scratch
      - ${HOST_DOCKER_CONFIG_DIR-${HOME}/.docker}:/root/.docker:ro
volumes:
  scratch:
```

##### Core Logic

The agent executes the following core logic in the interval defined by the `DISTR_INTERVAL` (default 5 seconds) environment variable:
1. Fetch the deployments from `DISTR_RESOURCE_ENDPOINT`
2. Delete docker compose projects that are not in the fetched list of deployments anymore (i.e. got undeployed), with `docker compose down -v`
3. Up docker compose projects that are in the fetched list of deployments, with `docker compose up -d`.
4. Send each docker compose output to the Distr Hub via `DISTR_STATUS_ENDPOINT`, thereby reporting the deployment's status.

All the requests against the Distr Hub are authenticated with a JWT token, which is obtained by the agent
by calling the `DISTR_LOGIN_ENDPOINT` with the `DISTR_TARGET_ID` and `DISTR_TARGET_SECRET` credentials.

The compose project names of the deployments are of the structure `distr-<short-deployment-id>`, so one deployment in Distr
matches one docker compose project on the host.

In order to be able to use the `docker` binary of the host system, the agent needs to have the docker socket mounted into the container.
It also mounts the docker config directory of the host system into the container, so that authentication secrets can be reused.

##### Agent Self Updates

##### Metrics

### Helm Agent

The Helm agent specializes in Kubernetes deployments, managing the complete lifecycle of Helm charts in customer environments. It handles chart installation and upgrades, monitors Kubernetes resource health, supports customer-specific value overrides, and provides rollback capabilities for failed deployments.

### Terraform Agent (Coming Soon)

<Aside type="caution" title="Currently in development">
  The Terraform agent is designed for Bring Your Own Cloud (BYOC) deployments
  and is currently in development.

#### Configuration Steps

Follow the configuration steps in the [Deployment Agent Quickstart Guide](/docs/guides/container-registry-for-end-customers/#deployment-agent-quickstart-from-the-customer-portal).

## Section Components

The Deployment Agents section of Distr consists of two main components that work together to provide a complete deployment management solution.

### Applications

<ThemedImage
  lightSrc={agentApplicationsLight}
  darkSrc={agentApplicationsDark}
  alt="Applications interface"
/>

The Applications section provides vendors with a dedicated space to configure and manage their software offerings. Using either Docker Compose files or Helm charts, vendors can define their application templates, specify which environment variables are configurable by customers, and manage different versions of their applications. This section serves as the foundation for all subsequent deployment activities.

For detailed instructions on adding applications to Distr, see our platform management guides:

- [Onboarding a Docker Application](/docs/guides/onboarding-a-docker-app/)
- [Onboarding a Helm Application](/docs/guides/onboarding-a-helm-app/)

### Deployments

### Deployments Overview

The **Deployments** section acts as the central management and health dashboard for all deployments.

Use this section to:

- Monitor the real-time health and status of all deployments
- View deployment metadata and logs
- Track deployment states across all customer environments

## Agent Capabilities

All Distr agents share a common set of core capabilities designed to ensure reliable and secure deployments. These include guided installation processes, automated application updates, comprehensive health monitoring, log aggregation for troubleshooting, and secure, outbound-only communication with the Distr Hub.

<Aside>
  We also working on read-only version of the Distr agent that will not be able
  to alter a deployment, but just monitor the deployment status and report logs
  and metrics.
</Aside>

### Deployment Health

The Deployments page shows status information on both deployment target and deployment level.

The Distr agent, which is deployed once per deployment target, reconciles the state of the deployment target every 5 seconds,
thereby also reporting the health of the deployment target and the contained deployments.

A deployment target status can be:

- Not connected: the dot to the left of the deployment target name is grey.
- Connected: the dot is green.
- Stale, i.e. the agent has been connected before, but did not report its health in the last 60 seconds: the dot is yellow. Only in this case,
  you have the option to Reconnect the agent by creating new credentials for the agent. Please note that this will invalidate the previous credentials.

A deployment status can be:

- No status: The agent did not report anything regarding this deployment yet.
- Error: the dot is red.
- Stale: The agent has not reported the deployments health in the last 60 seconds.
- Progressing: The agent is currently installing or upgrading the deployment, due to your previous request.
- OK: The deployment is healthy and running.
