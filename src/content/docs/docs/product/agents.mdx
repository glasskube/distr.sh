Deployment Agents are a core component of the Distr platform, designed to run within customer environments alongside vendor applications. These lightweight agents bridge the gap between the Distr Hub and deployment targets, enabling comprehensive lifecycle management requiring minimal access to customer infrastructure.

<Aside type="note">
  Distr deployment agents are the key components that enable the [Assisted
  Self-Managed Customer](/docs/use-cases/assisted-self-managed/) and
  [BYOC](/docs/use-cases/byoc-bring-your-own-cloud/) use cases.
</Aside>

## Agent Types

Distr offers specialized agents for different deployment tools, each designed to handle specific deployment scenarios while maintaining consistent core functionality.

### Docker Compose Agent

The Docker Compose agent is specifically designed for container-based deployments, providing comprehensive management of both single and multi-container applications. It handles application updates with minimal downtime, collects container health metrics and logs, and supports environment variable templating for flexible configuration.

<Aside type="note">
  Unless you're using Distr to deploy your own applications internally, the
  Distr agent will always be configured and deployed by the end customer. Head
  over to the [end-customer agent
  guide](/docs/guides/container-registry-for-end-customers/#deployment-agent-quickstart-from-the-customer-portal)
  to learn how it should be installed.
</Aside>

### Helm Agent

The Helm agent specializes in Kubernetes deployments, managing the complete lifecycle of Helm charts in customer environments. It handles chart installation and upgrades, monitors Kubernetes resource health, supports customer-specific value overrides, and provides rollback capabilities for failed deployments.

### Terraform Agent (Coming Soon)

<Aside type="note">
  The Terraform agent is designed for Bring Your Own Cloud (BYOC) deployments.
</Aside>

The upcoming Terraform agent will support provisioning infrastructure using Terraform modules stored in the Distr Registry. It will handle infrastructure and application deployment, manage customer-specific variables, and track state and versioning, useful for cases where vendors need to set up cloud resources before deploying applications.

#### Configuration Steps

Follow the configuration steps in the [Deployment Agent Quickstart Guide](/docs/guides/container-registry-for-end-customers/#deployment-agent-quickstart-from-the-customer-portal).

## Section Components

The Deployment Agents section of Distr consists of two main components that work together to provide a complete deployment management solution.

### Applications

  darkSrc="/src/assets/docs/product/deployment-agents/agent-applications-dark.png"
  alt="Applications interface"
/>

The Applications section provides vendors with a dedicated space to configure and manage their software offerings. Using either Docker Compose files or Helm charts, vendors can define their application templates, specify which environment variables are configurable by customers, and manage different versions of their applications. This section serves as the foundation for all subsequent deployment activities.

For detailed instructions on adding applications to Distr, see our platform management guides:

- [Onboarding a Docker Application](/docs/guides/onboarding-a-docker-app/)
- [Onboarding a Helm Application](/docs/guides/onboarding-a-helm-app/)

### Deployments

### Deployments Overview

The **Deployments** section acts as the central management and health dashboard for both vendor-managed and customer-controlled deployments.

Use this section to:

- Monitor the real-time health and status of all deployments
- View deployment metadata and logs
- Track deployment states across all customer environments

### Color-Coded Health Status

Deployment health is shown using color-coded status badges:

- **ðŸ”´ Error (Red)**
  The deployment failed. Error logs are available, and remediation is required.
  âž¤ _New deployments cannot be created until the error is resolved._

  **Troubleshooting steps:**

  - **Identify the issue:**
    - Check agent logs via the **Status** button
    - If possible, check the runtime logs (Container or Application logs)
  - **If it's a connectivity issue:**
    - Ensure the target environment is running
    - Confirm the correct namespace exists (for Helm)
    - If using Docker Desktop on macOS, follow this [guide](/docs/guides/distr-on-macos/)
  - **If it's a config issue:**
    - Follow the config style rules provided in the customer portal
    - Check YAML indentation
  - **If unresolved:**
    Contact the software vendor for support.

- **ðŸŸ¡ Stale (Yellow)**
  The agent hasn't made a `resource` request to Distr Hub in the last 60 seconds.
  âž¤ _This indicates a communication issue. No new deployments can be made until the agent is healthy._

  **Troubleshooting steps:**

  - Check environment connectivity:
    - Ensure the target environment is online
    - Confirm the agent is running
    - Review agent logs
  - **If unresolved:**
    Contact the software vendor for support.

- **ðŸŸ¢ OK (Green)**
  The agent is actively communicating with Distr Hub and reporting a healthy application state.
  âž¤ _New deployments are allowed. The **+ Deployment** button will be visible._

## Agent Capabilities

All Distr agents share a common set of core capabilities designed to ensure reliable and secure deployments. These include guided installation processes, automated application updates, comprehensive health monitoring, log aggregation for troubleshooting, and secure, outbound-only communication with the Distr Hub.

<Aside>
  We are also developing an embeddable agent SDK that can be integrated directly
  into vendor applications, providing a more seamless deployment experience with
  minimal additional components. For more information, feel free to reach out.
