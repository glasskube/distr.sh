<details>
  <summary>What is Distr?</summary>
  <p>
    Distr is an open-core commercial software distribution platform designed for
    Software and AI companies to manage and deploy software to
    customer-controlled environments.

<details>
  <summary>How do Distr agents work?</summary>
  <p>
    Distr agents are lightweight components that are installed in the target
    deployment environment and can be delivered by Distr or embedded directly
    into the vendor's Helm charts or Docker Compose files. They handle lifecycle
    tasks such as installation, updates, and rollbacks while providing essential
    metrics and logs.

<details>
  <summary>Can I customize the Distr platform for my brand?</summary>
  <p>
    Yes, Distr can be white-labeled with your branding, providing a consistent
    experience for your customers and making the platform appear as an extension
    of your product suite.

<details>
  <summary>Can I toggle between Vendor and Customer portal?</summary>
  <p>
    {' '}
    No, there is no way to toggle between the Vendor and Customer views. If a
    vendor wants to manage their own deployments, they can do so using the
    Deployments tab within the Vendor Portal. The Customer Portal is only
    accessible to end-customers who have been onboarded by a software vendor.
    After onboarding, the customer will receive an email to set their
    credentials. Once the credentials are set, the end-customer can access the
    Customer Portal.{' '}

<details>
  <summary>
    Can I restrict end-user access to software if a contract expires?
  </summary>
  <p>
    {' '}
    Yes, through the [License management feature](/docs/guides/license-mgmt/),
    Vendors can set expiration dates for each license. Once an expiration date
    expires, the end customer will no longer have access to the software
    versions previously granted by the license.{' '}

<details>
  <summary>
    Can I simulate a target environment on a MacOS machine for testing purposes?
  </summary>
  <p>
    {' '}
    Yes, definitely. If you want to simulate a target environment by running a
    container hosting emulator like [Docker
    Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) on your macOS
    machine, check out this [short guide](/docs/guides/distr-on-macos/). It
    covers the configuration steps needed to ensure Distr can communicate with
    the Docker daemon.{' '}
