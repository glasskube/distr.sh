Distr Hub is made up of two user interfaces: One for Software and AI vendors and the other for their end-customers

The Vendor portal is the primary interface for interacting with the Distr hub.

Since Distr is a platform specifically built for Software and AI companies, the vendor portal serves as the gateway to access all Distr features. In contrast, the [Customer Portal](/docs/product/customer-portal/) is a simplified version of the vendor portal, designed to provide end-customers with the ability to configure and control their distributions.

The vendor portal offers:

1. A main dashboard featuring uptime metrics, graphs, and table widgets to monitor and manage applications and deployments.
2. The `"Applications"` tab, where users can add multiple applications and host multiple versions simultaneously, allowing end customers to deploy different versions as needed.
3. The `"Customers"` tab, for managing customer information.
4. Deployment management, to oversee and control internally deployed applications.
5. A section to manage the users on your team.
6. The branding section
7. A light/dark mode toggle button.
8. An account setting section.

The Customer Portal provides end-customers with the essential features they need to manage the deployment of the vendor's applications. Compared to the Vendor Portal, it is intentionally more basic, following a "less is more" approach. This design philosophy acknowledges that end-customer should only care about their deployments and should not have to deal with anything else cluttering their management console.

The customer portal offers:

#### 1. Management of all deployment from a single pane

#### 2. Access to view current deployment logs

#### 3. Ability to edit deployment configurations

#### 4. Ability to deploy new versions of an application

The Customer Portal can be [customized](/docs/product/branding/) with the vendor's corporate logo and name, making Distr feel like an extension of the software company's product rather than just another tool for the end-customer to adopt and learn.
