Distr Hub includes two user interfaces: the Vendor Portal, designed for software and AI vendors, and the Customer Portal, a self-service interface for their end customers.

The Vendor Portal serves as the control plane for vendors, providing access to all Distr features, including application configuration, artifact registry management, and monitoring of end-customer deployment states. In contrast, the [Customer Portal](/docs/guides/end-customer-registry-view/) offers a simplified interface for end customers, allowing them to configure and manage their deployments while centralizing release information and helpful instructions for operating the vendor’s software.

### What Vendors Can Do in the Vendor Portal

1. **Access onboarding tutorials**: A great place to [start](/docs/getting-started/quickstart/#getting-started-with-platform-tutorials) your journey with Distr and get familiar with the platform’s capabilities.

2. **View the global dashboard**: Monitor the health status of both internal deployments and customer-managed applications and artifacts.

3. **Onboard and configure applications**: Use the _Agent_ section to register applications and the _Deployments_ section to manage updates for internally deployed application and monitor the health of end-customer deployed workloads.

4. **Manage the registry**: Browse and manage stored artifacts in the _Registry_ section.

5. **Configure licenses**: Define application and artifact licenses to control access to specific versions or tags.

6. **Manage administrative settings**: Admin sections include tools to manage customer accounts, internal users, branding for the Customer Portal, and global platform settings.

### What Customers Can Do in the Customer Portal

1. **Explore vendor-provided documentation**: The homepage serves as the end-customer’s landing pad, offering release notes, agent and registry instructions, helpful links, and support information. It’s the go-to place for understanding how to install and maintain the vendor’s software.

2. **Deploy and manage agents**: In the _Deployments_ section, customers can deploy agents to their internal infrastructure. These agents can then be used to manage one or multiple deployments.

3. **Access and consume artifacts**: The _Artifacts_ section displays the software artifacts that have been enabled for the customer, along with instructions on how to pull and use them.

4. **Generate access tokens**: In the top-right corner, the _Customer Settings_ area allows users to generate Personal Access Tokens (PATs), which are required for authenticating with the registry.
