The Vendor Portal serves as the control plane for vendors, providing access to all Distr features, including [application onboarding](/docs/guides/onboarding-a-helm-app/), [artifact registry](/docs/guides/container-registry/) management, and monitoring of end-customer deployment states. In contrast, the [Customer Portal](/docs/product/customer-portal/) offers a simplified interface for end customers, allowing them to configure and manage their deployments while centralizing release information and helpful instructions for operating the vendorâ€™s software.
