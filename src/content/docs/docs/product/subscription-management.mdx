## Available Plans

Distr provides three subscription tiers:

- **Starter** - For validating your first POCs and testing with up to 3 customers
- **Pro** - For rolling out to multiple customers with license management and RBAC
- **Enterprise** - For organizations using Distr as their complete commercial platform

## Managing Your Subscription

### Accessing Subscription Management

Subscription management is available in the **Subscription** section of the Vendor Portal:

1. Log in to the [Vendor Portal](https://app.distr.sh/subscription)
2. Click **Subscription** in the sidebar
3. View your current subscription status, limits, and usage

### Viewing Subscription Details

The Subscription page displays:

- **Current Usage** - How many customers and users you're currently using
- **Usage Limits** - Current limits for customer organizations and user accounts
- **Current Subscription Type** - Your active plan (Pro Trial, Starter, Pro, or Enterprise)
- **Subscription Renewal Date** - When your current subscription renews

### Managing Customers and Users Within Your Plan

You can add customer organizations and internal users within your current subscription plan limits:

- **Adding Customers** - Add new customer organizations up to your plan's limit through the Vendor Portal
- **Adding Users** - Add internal team members and customer users within your plan's user account limits
- **Self-Service** - These operations are available directly in the Vendor Portal without requiring plan changes

<Aside type="tip">
  Monitor your usage in the Subscription section to see how many customers and
  users you're currently using versus your plan limits.
</Aside>

### Updating Your Subscription

#### Changing between Plans (e.g. Starter to Pro)

**Plan changes (upgrades or downgrades) cannot be made through the Vendor Portal.** To upgrade or downgrade your subscription plan:

1. Contact our support team via email at **support@glasskube.com**
2. Specify whether you want to upgrade or downgrade and which plan you'd like to switch to
3. Our team will process your request and guide you through the transition

### Quantity Updates During Billing Cycle

You can add internal Users and Customers within your plan limits in the middle of a billing cycle.

#### Adding Users or Customers During a Billing Cycle

When you add more customers or users to your Pro plan mid-cycle:

- **Immediate Access** - The additional customers and users become available immediately
- **Prorated Charges** - You'll be charged a prorated amount for the additional customers and users for the remainder of the current billing cycle
- **Next Billing Cycle** - The prorated amount will be added to your next month's invoice

**Example:**

If you're on a Pro plan and add more customers on day 15 of a monthly billing cycle:

- You currently have 10 customers on your Pro plan
- You add 5 more customers (now 15 total)
- You've used 15 days of your current billing cycle
- You'll be charged a prorated amount for the 5 additional customers for the remaining 15 days
- This prorated amount appears on your next month's invoice
- You immediately gain access to the additional customers

#### Reducing Internal Users or Customers During a Billing Cycle

When you downgrade your plan mid-cycle, the new plan and its limits take effect right away. To ensure a smooth transition, make sure your account is already within the limits of the plan you're switching to. If you currently have more customers or users than the new plan allows, you'll need to remove the excess before completing the downgrade.

Once you're within the new plan's limits:

- **Immediate Plan Change** – Your subscription updates right away
- **Continued Access** – You keep access to your remaining customers and users for the rest of the current billing cycle
- **Next Billing Cycle** – Your next month's invoice will simply reflect the price of your new plan

**Example:**
If you're on the Pro plan with 5 customers and want to move to a plan that allows 3 customers:

- Reduce your customer count from 5 to 3
- Once you're at 3 customers, you can downgrade immediately
- You continue using the new plan for the rest of your current billing cycle
- Starting next month, your invoice reflects the new plan's pricing

### Cancelling Your Subscription

Subscriptions can be cancelled through the Stripe Customer Portal:

1. Navigate to the **Subscription** section in the Vendor Portal
2. Click **Manage Subscription** - This opens the Stripe Customer Portal
3. In Stripe, navigate to your subscription
4. Click **Cancel Subscription**
5. Your subscription will remain active until the end of your current billing period
6. After cancellation, you'll lose access to paid features but can continue using the platform with Starter-tier limitations

<Aside type="note">
  After cancelling, you can reactivate your subscription through the Stripe
  Customer Portal or by selecting a new plan in the Vendor Portal.
