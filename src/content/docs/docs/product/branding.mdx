The white-labeling section of the Vendor Portal allows you to apply your own branding to the UI that customers use to deploy and manage your software.

A well-configured Customer Portal should provide all the information your end users need to install, operate, and troubleshoot your software independently.

## How to White-label Distr

1. In the Vendor Portal, go to the Branding tab in the sidebar.
2. Fill in your company's branding details:
   - Recommended Content for the Customer Portal Dashboard:
     - Release notes for the current version
     - Installation, connection and upgrade instructions
     - Troubleshooting tips
     - Links to relevant documentation
3. Review and save your changes.

Branding configuration view:

<ThemeImage

  darkSrc="/src/assets/docs/product/branding/branding-config-dark.png"
  alt="Helm Agent interface"
/>

After saving, the [Customer Portal](/docs/product/customer-portal/) is rebranded for your end users:

  darkSrc="/src/assets/docs/product/vendor-portal/customer-portal-dark.png"
  alt="Deployments interface"
