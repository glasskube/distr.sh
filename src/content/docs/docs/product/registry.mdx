The Distr Artifact Registry is a built-in, [OCI-compliant](https://github.com/opencontainers/distribution-spec?tab=readme-ov-file) registry designed for software vendors who need full control over how their software artifacts are distributed to end-customers. It supports container images, Helm charts, SBOMs, and other OCI artifacts, all managed directly within your [Distr account](https://signup.distr.sh/).

<Aside type="note">
  The Distr Artifacts Registry is the core feature that enables the [Fully
  Self-Managed Customer](/docs/use-cases/fully-managed/) and [Air
  gapped](/docs/use-cases/air-gapped/) use cases.
</Aside>

Use it to publish versioned artifacts, enforce licensing rules, and track consumption across your customer base, with full visibility and fine-grained access control.

### Core capabilities

- **Multi-artifact support**: Distribute Helm charts, container images, configuration bundles, and any OCI-compliant artifact
- **Software supply chain security**: Store SBOMs and signatures for safer distribution
- **Visibility**: Track where, how, and by whom artifacts are consumed
- **Open standards**: Built on the OCI specification and compatible with existing tooling (Docker, ORAS, etc.)
- **Built-in licensing (beta)**: Bind artifacts to licenses for fine-grained customer access control

## Registry User Flow

As a vendor, here’s how you’ll typically use the registry:

1. To start using the registry [choose a registry slug](/docs/product/registry/#use-the-registry) and [log in](/docs/product/registry/#registry-login).
2. [Tag and push](/docs/product/registry/#registry-login) your artifacts to the registry, you can manage this from the [Artifacts](/docs/product/registry/#artifacts) section.
3. Once stored, your artifacts can be made available to your end-customers via their favourite registry CLI tool (Docker, ORAS, etc.).
4. Use the [Downloads](/docs/product/registry/#downloads) section to monitor how your customers are consuming your artifacts.
5. (Optional) We also offer a [Licensing](/docs/product/registry/#registry-license-management) feature (currently in beta) that lets you bind artifacts to licenses on a 1:1 basis. This gives you fine-grained control over which customers can access specific artifacts, even down to individual versions.

Let’s take a closer look at each component.

## Registry Components

The Registry section consists of three main components:

### Artifacts

The _Artifacts_ section, underneath the Registry drop down on the left side panel allows you to:

- Upload binary artifacts and software components
- Manage different versions of your artifacts
- Easily access artifact IDs
- View usage metrics

Artifacts stored in the registry can be anything from executable binaries to configuration files, documentation, or any other resources your customers might need.

<Aside type="note">
  Once an artifact is pushed to the registry, it becomes immutable. Tags cannot
  be modified or reused.
</Aside>

#### Use the registry

To use the registry, you need to set a registry slug at the organization level. This only needs to be configured once in the Distr account settings.

**Set Organization Slug**

The slug will be used as part of the url for artifact registry.

<Aside type="caution">
  The registry slug must start with a lower case letter or digit and consist
  only of lowercase letters, digits, as well as the following special
  characters: **“.”, “_”, “__”, “-”**.
</Aside>

#### Registry login

To login to the registry, you'll have to create a [personal access token](/docs/integrations/personal-access-token/) and use it in the following login command:

```bash
echo "YOUR-ACCESS-TOKEN" | docker login distr-registry:8585 --password-stdin -u -
```

Then you can start tagging and pushing images to your account level registry.

For example, you can try the following commands to push your own `hello-world` image:

```bash
docker pull hello-world
docker tag hello-world distr-registry:8585/distr-registry/hello-world:v1.0.0
docker push distr-registry:8585/distr-registry/hello-world:v1.0.0
```

### Downloads

The _Downloads_ section gives you detailed insight into how your end-customers are using your artifacts, think of it as CloudTrail, but for your registry.

Here, you’ll find:

- A complete log of artifact downloads
- Metadata like the customer’s IP address, download date, and the specific artifact accessed
- Download history organized by customer

This visibility helps you better understand how your artifacts are being used and distributed across your customer base.

### Licenses

<Aside type="note">
  Registry Licenses is available in beta. Contact us to get early access, we’ll
  activate it for your account today!
</Aside>

_Registry licenses_ provide 1:1 access control for end customers, linking directly to specific artifacts, even down to individual versions.

Much like application licensing, Registry Licensing lets you:

- Control which customers can access which artifacts
- Set expiration dates for artifact access
- Manage authentication for private registry usage
- Create bundles of artifacts that can be licensed together

#### Creating a License:

To create a license, you’ll:

1. Give it a **name**
2. Set an **expiration date**
3. **Select the artifacts** you want to include
4. **Choose the scope**. All tags, specific tags, or just a single version
5. **Assign an owner**, this is the end customer the license is tied to

Licensing gives you precise control over software access and ensures that only authorized customers can download and use your distributions.
