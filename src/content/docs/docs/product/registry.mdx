The Distr Artifact Registry is a built-in, [OCI-compliant](https://github.com/opencontainers/distribution-spec?tab=readme-ov-file) registry designed for AI and software companies
to distribute Docker images and Helm Charts, SBOMs and other OCI artifacts to self-managed and BYOC environments.
It features advanced tag-based access and licensing controls.
The registry also provides detailed download analytics that let you monitor which versions of your software are being used by each customer.

Use it to publish versioned artifacts, enforce licensing rules, and track consumption across your customer base.

<Aside type="note">
  The Distr Artifact registry is a private registry, meaning that only
  [authenticated](/docs/guides/container-registry/#2-authenticate-with-a-personal-access-token)
  users via PAT can push and pull artifacts. Unauthenticated users will not be
  able to access your artifacts.

### Core capabilities

- **Multi-artifact support**: Distribute Docker Images, Helm Charts, Terraform Modules, and any OCI-compliant artifact
- **Software supply chain security**: Store SBOMs and signatures for image verification
- **Visibility**: Get insights into which customers are using which artifacts and versions
- **Open standards**: Built on the OCI specification and compatible with existing tooling (Docker, ORAS, Helm, etc.)
- **Built-in licensing (beta)**: Bind artifact (versions) to licenses for fine-grained customer access control

## Getting started

<Aside type="note">
  If you haven’t set up your registry yet, start with the [in-platform
  tutorials](/docs/getting-started/quickstart/#getting-started-with-platform-tutorials)
  or follow the [Quickstart Guide](/docs/guides/container-registry/).

## Artifact Registry UI

### Artifact List

The Artifact List page lets you view all artifacts stored in your registry. It provides an overview of pull counts across all tags, along with insights into which users and customers are using each artifact.

<ThemedImage
  lightSrc={artifactsListLight}
  darkSrc={artifactsListDark}
  alt="Registry artifacts view"
/>

### Artifact Details

The artifact details page gives you a complete view of all tags associated with a specific artifact. You can see the OCI URL, upload date, and artifact size, along with pull counts for each tag.

<ThemedImage
  lightSrc={artifactDetailsLight}
  darkSrc={artifactDetailsDark}
  alt="Registry artifacts view"
/>

<Aside type="note">
  The Distr artifact registry only supports immutable tags. This means that once
  a tag is pushed to the registry it can't be associated with another digest.
</Aside>

### Artifact Downloads

The Downloads section shows a chronological list of all downloaded artifacts, including which user downloaded them and from which IP address.

<ThemedImage

  darkSrc={downloadDark}

/>

## Global Dashboard Artifact View

The main Distr dashboard also provides a global view of which artifacts each end customer has consumed, including version details and a health status.

## Artifact Deletion

The Distr registry includes sophisticated deletion logic to protect artifacts and tags that are actively referenced in licenses, ensuring customers maintain access to their licensed software.

### Deleting Artifact Tags

You can delete individual tags from an artifact through the API and UI. However, the system enforces several validation rules to prevent breaking customer access.

#### When Tag Deletion is Allowed

Tag deletion succeeds when all of these conditions are met:

- The tag exists and is not referenced in any artifact license
- If the underlying manifest digest is referenced in licenses, other non-SHA tags must exist for that digest

<Aside type="tip">
  The system distinguishes between regular tags (like `v1.0.0`, `latest`) and
  SHA digest tags (like `sha256:abc123...`). As artifact version access is
  always checked by the underlying digest, it is possible to untag a licensed
  version, if multiple tags point to it.
</Aside>

#### Example: Tag Deletion Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Safe deletion**

> Artifact: myapp
> Tags: v1.0.0, v1.0.1, latest (all point to different digests)
> License: References sha256:abc123 (v1.0.0's digest)
>
> Action: Delete tag "v1.0.1"
> Result: Success - v1.0.1 is not licensed and not the last tag

**Scenario 2: Blocked deletion - licensed digest**

> Artifact: myapp
> Tags: v1.0.0 (points to sha256:abc123)
> License: References sha256:abc123
>
> Action: Delete tag "v1.0.0"
> Result: Blocked (400) - Cannot delete last non-SHA tag for licensed digest

**Scenario 3: Blocked deletion - last tag**

> Artifact: myapp
> Tags: v1.0.0 (only tag remaining)
> No licenses
>
> Action: Delete tag "v1.0.0"
> Result: Blocked (409) - At least one tag must remain

### Deleting Artifacts

You can delete entire artifacts from your registry, which will cascade to all associated versions,
tags and historical download data.

#### When Artifact Deletion is Allowed

Artifacts can be deleted when they are not referenced in any active licenses.

<Aside type="caution">
  Deleting an artifact is a cascade operation that automatically removes all
  associated artifact versions, tags, and parts. This action cannot be undone.
  Ensure the artifact is not referenced in any licenses before deletion.
</Aside>

#### Best Practices

- **Check licenses first**: Before deleting artifacts or tags, verify they are not referenced in customer licenses
- **Use caution with tags**: Deleting tags can affect customer access if not done carefully
- **Monitor usage**: Review the Downloads section to understand which artifacts and versions are actively used
- **Keep at least one tag**: The system requires at least one non-SHA tag per artifact to maintain discoverability
