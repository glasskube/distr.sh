The Distr Artifact Registry is a built-in, [OCI-compliant](https://github.com/opencontainers/distribution-spec?tab=readme-ov-file) registry designed for AI and software companies
to distribute Docker images and Helm Charts, SBOMs and other OCI artifacts to self-managed and BYOC deployments.
It features advanced tag-based access and licensing controls.
Additionally, you can track individual artifact tag downloads to track on which version of your software your customers are using.

Use it to publish versioned artifacts, enforce licensing rules, and track consumption across your customer base.

<Aside type="note">
  The Distr Artifact registry is a private registry, meaning that only
  authenticated users can push and pull artifacts. Unauthenticated users will
  not be able to access your artifacts.

### Core capabilities

- **Multi-artifact support**: Distribute Docker Images, Helm Charts, Terraform Modules, and any OCI-compliant artifact
- **Software supply chain security**: Store SBOMs and signatures for image verification
- **Visibility**: Get insights into which customers are using which artifacts and versions
- **Open standards**: Built on the OCI specification and compatible with existing tooling (Docker, ORAS, Helm, etc.)
- **Built-in licensing (beta)**: Bind artifact (versions) to licenses for fine-grained customer access control

## Quickstart

After the license feature is enabled, you can start using the Distr Artifact Registry.

1. To start using the registry, choose a registry slug and log in.
2. Tag and push your artifacts to the registry, you can manage this from the Artifacts section.
3. Once stored, your artifacts can be assigned by other users and end-customers via their favourite registry CLI tool (Docker, ORAS, Kubernetes, etc.).
4. Use the Downloads section to get granular analytics.
5. (Optional) If you want to restrict access to specific artifacts or versions, you can create licenses that bind customers to specific artifacts and versions.

## Registry Features

The Registry section consists of three main components:

<ThemeImage
  lightSrc="/src/assets/docs/product/registry/light-registry-sections.png"
  darkSrc="/src/assets/docs/product/registry/dark-registry-sections.png"
  alt="Registry artifacts view"
/>

### Artifacts List

The artifact list page is where you can view all the artifacts stored in your registry.
You can get an overview about the pull count over all tags and how many users and customers using which artifact.

<ThemeImage
  lightSrc="/src/assets/docs/product/registry/light-registry-artifacts.png"
  darkSrc="/src/assets/docs/product/registry/dark-registry-artifacts.png"
  alt="Registry artifacts view"
/>

### Artifact Details

The artifact details page provides you with a detailed view about all tags of a specific artifact.
You can geht the oci url if the artifact and the upload date and artifact size.
You can get an overview about the pull count over for each tag.

<Aside type="note">
  The Distr artifact registry only supports immutable tags. This means that once
  a tag is pushed to the registry it can't be associated with another digest.
</Aside>

### Artifact Downloads

The Downloads section gives you a chronological list of all artifacts that have been downloaded by which user from which IP adress.

<ThemeImage
  lightSrc="/src/assets/docs/product/registry/light-artifact-downloads.png"
  darkSrc="/src/assets/docs/product/registry/dark-artifact-downloads.png"
  alt="Registry artifacts view"
/>

Using this information, Distr can provide you the information if a user is on the latest version of your software or not.

## Using the registry as a vendor

### Getting started

To use the registry, you need to set a registry slug at the organization level. This only needs to be configured once in the Distr account settings.

**Set Organization Slug**

<ThemeImage
  lightSrc="/src/assets/docs/product/registry/light-slug.png"
  darkSrc="/src/assets/docs/product/registry/dark-slug.png"
  alt="Registry artifacts view"
/>

The slug will be used as part of the url for artifact registry.

<Aside type="caution">
  The registry slug must start with a lower case letter or digit and consist
  only of lowercase letters, digits, as well as the following special
  characters: **“.”, “_”, “__”, “-”**.
</Aside>

#### Registry login

To login to the registry, you'll have to create a [personal access token (PAT)](/docs/integrations/personal-access-token/) and use it in the following login command:

<Aside type="note">
  The Distr artifact registry does not require a username when login in. The PAT
  is directly associated with your user account.
</Aside>

```bash
echo "YOUR-ACCESS-TOKEN" | docker login distr-registry:8585 --password-stdin -u -
```

Then you can start tagging and pushing images to your account level registry.

For example, you can try the following commands to push your own `hello-world` image:

```bash
docker pull hello-world
docker tag hello-world registry.distr.sh/slug/hello-world:1.0.0
docker push registry.distr.sh/slug/hello-world:1.0.0
```

### Licenses

<Aside type="note">
  Registry Licenses is available in beta. Contact us to get early access!
</Aside>

_Registry licenses_ restricts which artifacts end customers are able to access even down to individual versions.
One license can be a bundle of multiple artifacts and versions.
A customer can be associated with multiple licenses.
A license can have an expiration date, if the expiration date is empty the license will not expire.

#### Creating a License:

To create a license, you’ll:

1. Give it a **name**
2. Set an **expiration date**
3. **Select the artifacts** you want to include
4. **Choose the scope**. All tags, specific tags, or just a single tag.
5. **Assign the owner** this is the end customer the license is tied to

<Aside type="note">
  The scope of a license can't be reduced. So an artifact can't get unassigned
  from a license.
</Aside>

## Using the registry as an end-customer

TODO: Add image that clearly shows the difference between the vendor and customer portal (less download icons etc - indicating the end-customer can only pull, but see the latest version)
