The Distr Artifact Registry is a built-in, [OCI-compliant](https://github.com/opencontainers/distribution-spec?tab=readme-ov-file) registry designed for AI and software companies
to distribute Docker images and Helm Charts, SBOMs and other OCI artifacts to self-managed and BYOC environments.
It features advanced tag-based access and licensing controls.
The registry also provides detailed download analytics that let you monitor which versions of your software are being used by each customer.

Use it to publish versioned artifacts, enforce licensing rules, and track consumption across your customer base.

<Aside type="note">
  The Distr Artifact registry is a private registry, meaning that only
  [authenticated](/docs/guides/container-registry/#2-authenticate-with-a-personal-access-token)
  users via PAT can push and pull artifacts. Unauthenticated users will not be
  able to access your artifacts.

### Core capabilities

- **Multi-artifact support**: Distribute Docker Images, Helm Charts, Terraform Modules, and any OCI-compliant artifact
- **Software supply chain security**: Store SBOMs and signatures for image verification
- **Visibility**: Get insights into which customers are using which artifacts and versions
- **Open standards**: Built on the OCI specification and compatible with existing tooling (Docker, ORAS, Helm, etc.)
- **Built-in licensing (beta)**: Bind artifact (versions) to licenses for fine-grained customer access control

## Getting started

<Aside type="note">
  If you havenâ€™t set up your registry yet, start with the [in-platform
  tutorials](/docs/getting-started/quickstart/#getting-started-with-platform-tutorials)
  or follow the [Quickstart Guide](/docs/guides/container-registry/).

## Artifact Registry UI

### Artifact List

The Artifact List page lets you view all artifacts stored in your registry. It provides an overview of pull counts across all tags, along with insights into which users and customers are using each artifact.

  darkSrc={artifactsListDark}
  alt="Registry artifacts view"
/>

### Artifact Details

The artifact details page gives you a complete view of all tags associated with a specific artifact. You can see the OCI URL, upload date, and artifact size, along with pull counts for each tag.

<ThemedImage

  darkSrc={artifactDetailsDark}
  alt="Registry artifacts view"
/>

<Aside type="note">
  The Distr artifact registry only supports immutable tags. This means that once
  a tag is pushed to the registry it can't be associated with another digest.

### Artifact Downloads

The Downloads section shows a chronological list of all downloaded artifacts, including which user downloaded them and from which IP address.

## Global Dashboard Artifact View

The main Distr dashboard also provides a global view of which artifacts each end customer has consumed, including version details and a health status.
