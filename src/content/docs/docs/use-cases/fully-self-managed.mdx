The Fully Self-Managed deployment model gives security-conscious end-customers complete control over their infrastructure with no third-party agents or access. This registry-centric model serves organizations with restrictive security policies, regulatory requirements, or internal policies prohibiting third-party access.

Distr provides a private artifact registry that enables controlled software distribution while respecting customer autonomy. Customers pull updates on their own schedule, maintaining full control over when and how updates are deployed.
