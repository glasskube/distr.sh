title: Fully Self-Managed Deployment
description: In fully self-managed deployments, customers use access tokens to pull artifacts directly from Distrâ€™s private OCI-compliant registry, with a built-in UI in the Customer Portal that displays all available artifacts, no agents or external dependencies required.

The Fully Self-Managed deployment model is designed for environments where third-party access is not an option.
It is best suited for customers wanting to have full control over their infrastructure and don't want to use external agents.
For this deployment model, Distr provides a [private artifact registry](/docs/product/registry/).
It comes with an [optimized UI](/docs/product/registry/#artifact-registry-ui) that enables customers
to create access tokens, fetch the latest images and build custom automations on top if the registry.
