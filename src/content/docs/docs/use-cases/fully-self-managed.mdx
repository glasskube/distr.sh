The Fully Self-Managed deployment model is designed for environments where third-party access is not an option.
It is best suited for customers wanting to have full control over their infrastructure and don't want to use external agents.
For this deployment model, Distr provides a [private artifact registry](/docs/product/registry/).
It comes with an [optimized UI](/docs/product/registry/#artifact-registry-ui) that enables customers
to create access tokens, fetch the latest images and build custom automations on top if the registry.

## Implementation steps

  Ideal for customers with robust DevOps capabilities and strict security
  requirements around third-party tool access.

<Steps>

{/* steps can't be indented due to prettier */}

1. Set Up Your [Registry](/docs/guides/container-registry/)
2. Onboard Your [Application](/docs/guides/onboarding-a-helm-app/)
3. White-label the [Customer portal](/docs/product/branding/)
4. Onboard your first [customer](/docs/guides/onboarding-a-new-customer/)
5. Customer creates a [Personal Access token](/docs/integrations/personal-access-token/)
6. Customer can [access and pull](/docs/guides/container-registry-for-end-customers/#registry-quickstart-from-the-customer-portal) your private artifacts

</Steps>
