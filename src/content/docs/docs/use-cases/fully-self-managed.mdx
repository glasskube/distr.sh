The Fully Self-Managed deployment model is designed for environments where third-party access is not an option. It gives customers full control over their infrastructure, without the use of external agents. For this deployment model, Distr provides a [private artifact registry](/docs/product/registry/) with a [built-in UI](/docs/product/registry/#artifact-registry-ui) that enables customers to fetch and deploy software on their own schedule.

### Implementation steps

<Steps>
  1. **Set Up Your [Registry](/docs/guides/how-to-registry/)** 2. **Onboard Your
  [Application](/docs/guides/onboarding-a-helm-app/)** 3. **White-label the
  [Customer portal](/docs/product/branding/)** 4. **Onboard your first
  [customer](/docs/guides/onboarding-a-new-customer/)** 5. **Customer creates a
  [Personal Access token](/docs/integrations/personal-access-token/)** 6.
  **Customer can [access and
  pull](/docs/guides/end-customer-registry-view/#registry-quickstart-from-the-customer-portal)
  your private artifacts**
