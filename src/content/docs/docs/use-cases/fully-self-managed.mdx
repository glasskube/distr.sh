Fully Self-Managed deployment gives security-conscious enterprises complete control over their infrastructure with no vendor agents or access. This registry-centric model serves organizations with restrictive security policies, regulatory requirements, or internal policies prohibiting third-party access.

Distr provides a private artifact registry that enables controlled software distribution while respecting customer autonomy. Customers pull updates on their own schedule rather than receiving automated deployments, maintaining full control over when and how updates are deployed.
