The Fully Self-Managed deployment model gives security-conscious end-customers complete control over their infrastructure with no third-party agents or external access. This registry-centric model serves organizations with restrictive security policies, regulatory requirements, or internal policies prohibiting third-party access.

Distr provides a [private artifact registry](/docs/product/registry/) that enables controlled software distribution while respecting customer autonomy. Customers pull updates on their own schedule, maintaining full control over when and how updates are deployed.

### Implementation steps

<Steps>
  1. **Set Up Your [Registry](/docs/guides/how-to-registry/)** 2. **Onboard Your
  [Application](/docs/guides/onboarding-a-helm-app/)** 3. **White-label the
  [Customer portal](/docs/product/branding/)** 5. **Onboard your first
  [customer](/docs/guides/onboarding-a-new-customer/)** 6. **Customer creates a
  [Personal Access token](/docs/integrations/personal-access-token/)** 7.
  **Customer can [access and
  pull](/docs/guides/end-customer-registry-view/#registry-quickstart-from-the-customer-portal)
  your private artifacts**
