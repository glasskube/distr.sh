Bring Your Own Cloud (BYOC) provides fully vendor-managed operations within customer-owned cloud resources.
Perfect for organizations with strict data residency or compliance requirements that need to maintain ownership of their cloud infrastructure.

After connecting the end customers cloud account to Distr, the required infrastructure will be provisioned using the Terraform agent.
In the next step the initial infrastructure will be set up, afterward the vendor application will get deployed.
All further changes to the to applications or infrastructure will get applied by the Distr agents to ensure to all managed BYOC customers
are running the same version of the infrastructure and application.

<Steps>

{/* steps can't be indented due to prettier */}

1. Set Up Your [Registry](/docs/guides/container-registry/)
2. Onboard Your [Application](/docs/guides/onboarding-a-helm-app/)
3. White-label the [Customer portal](/docs/product/branding/)
4. Onboard your first [customer](/docs/guides/onboarding-a-new-customer/)
5. Reach out to the Distr team to connect the customer's target environment _(We are working hard on automating this step)_
6. Manage deployments and updates of your app directly for the customer using the [Distr agents](/docs/product/agents/)

</Steps>
