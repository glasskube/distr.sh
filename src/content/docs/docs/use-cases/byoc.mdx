[BYOC](https://glasskube.dev/glossary/byoc-definition/) deployments involve delivering commercial software to environments where the software vendor has some level of shared responsibility or permission to access and manage the customer-owned target deployment environment.

This model is well-suited for end customers who may lack extensive infrastructure expertise but still require third-party software to be deployed within their own data centers or cloud environments. These customers might have a small or non-existent technical team and are often comfortable granting the vendor access to a dedicated cloud account or direct access to devices within their infrastructure for management purposes.

The key distinction between BYOC and self-managed deployments is the approach to software updates. In BYOC scenarios, updates can be both **pulled** by the end customer **and pushed** directly by the vendor. This added flexibility simplifies update management for customers who may prefer or require additional support.

When onboarding a customer, vendors can determine whether BYOC support is needed. If so, the platform will enable upgrade-pushing capabilities, allowing vendors to manage updates proactively. Additionally, BYOC deployments provide vendors with the ability to customize configurations, such as Helm values, which are typically reserved for end customers in the self-managed deployment model. This customization capability allows vendors to tailor deployments to meet specific customer requirements.
