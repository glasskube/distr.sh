Distr supports air-gapped environments where strict security requirements demand physical or logical isolation from public networks. The air-gapped deployment model serves organizations in regulated industries (defense, finance, critical infrastructure) that cannot allow external connectivity or agents in their environment.

Distr offers two approaches: **IP Whitelisting** for environments that can permit limited external connections, and **Self-Hosted Registry with Physical Transfers** for completely isolated environments, where updates are delivered via encrypted physical media with cryptographic verification.

  This approach allows you to serve security-conscious customers without
  compromising their security posture or compliance requirements.
