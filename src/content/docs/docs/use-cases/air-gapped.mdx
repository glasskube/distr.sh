Distr supports air-gapped environments where strict security requirements demand physical or logical isolation from public networks. The air-gapped deployment model serves organizations in regulated industries (defense, finance, critical infrastructure) that cannot allow external connectivity or agents in their environment.

Distr offers two approaches: **IP Whitelisting** for environments that can permit limited external connections, and **Self-Hosted Registry with Physical Transfers** for completely isolated environments, where updates are delivered via encrypted physical media with cryptographic verification.

### Solution Architecture

  <TabItem label="IP Whitelisting Approach">
    <Steps>
    1. **Set Up Your [Registry](/docs/guides/how-to-registry/)**
    2. **Onboard Your [Application](/docs/guides/onboarding-a-helm-app/)**
    3. **White-label the [Customer portal](/docs/product/branding/)**
    4. **Onboard your first [customer](/docs/guides/onboarding-a-new-customer/)**
    5. **Request IP Allowlist for Customer Access**
    6. **Customer creates a [Personal Access token](/docs/integrations/personal-access-token/)**
    7. **Customer can [access and pull](/docs/guides/end-customer-registry-view/#registry-quickstart-from-the-customer-portal) your private artifacts**
    </Steps>

    <Aside type="tip">
      This approach works for environments where limited external connectivity is permitted
      and the Distr's IP addresses can be whitelisted for secure access.

  <TabItem label="Physical Transfer Approach">
    <Steps>
    1. **End-customer [self host Distr](/docs/self-hosting/getting-started/) in their internal environment**
    2. **Vendors deliver media to customer environment to be distributed internal via Distr**
    3. **Reach out to support@glasskube.com more detailed information of how Distr can enable this end-customer use case**
    </Steps>

    <Aside type="tip">
      This approach is ideal for completely isolated environments with no external network
      connectivity, using cryptographically verified physical transfers instead.
