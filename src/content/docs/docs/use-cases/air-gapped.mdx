Distr supports [air-gapped](/glossary/air-gapped-meaning/) environments where strict security requirements demand physical or logical isolation from public networks.
This deployment model is ideal for organizations in regulated industries, such as defense, finance, and critical infrastructure,
where external connectivity or the use of agents is not permitted.

Distr offers two approaches to support these environments:

1. **IP Whitelisting**: For environments that can allow limited outbound connections.
2. **[Self-Managed](/glossary/self-managed-software/) Registry with Physical Transfers**: For fully isolated environments, Distr supports a workflow where updates are packaged, encrypted, and physically transferred (e.g., via USB or secure media).

## Implementation Steps

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="IP Whitelisting Approach">
    <Aside type="note">
      This approach works for environments where limited external connectivity is permitted
      and the Distr's IP addresses can be whitelisted for secure access.
    </Aside>
    <Steps>
    1. Set Up Your [Registry](/docs/guides/container-registry/)
    2. Create Your [Application](/docs/guides/application/)
    3. White-label the [Customer portal](/docs/product/branding/)
    4. Onboard your first [customer](/docs/product/rbac/#inviting-customer-organization-users)
    5. Request IP Allowlist for Customer Access
    6. Customer creates a [Personal Access token](/docs/integrations/personal-access-token/)
    7. Customer can [access and pull](/docs/guides/container-registry-for-end-customers/#registry-quickstart-from-the-customer-portal) your private artifacts
    </Steps>

  <TabItem label="Physical Transfer Approach">
    <Aside type="note">
      This approach is ideal for completely isolated environments with no external network
      connectivity, using cryptographically verified physical transfers instead.
    </Aside>
    <Steps>
    1. End-customer [self hosts Distr](/docs/self-hosting/getting-started/) in their internal environment
    2. Vendors deliver media to customer environment to be deployed internally via Distr
    3. Reach out to support@glasskube.com for more detailed information of how Distr can enable this end-customer use case
