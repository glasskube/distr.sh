title: Assisted Self-Managed Deployment
description: Distr agents assist by running in end-customer environments, they pull application updates, apply configuration changes, report deployment statuses and authenticate automatically to the Distr registry, without granting vendor access to the target environment.

The Assisted Self-Managed deployment model offers a balance between customer infrastructure control and vendor assistance.
Applications run in customer-owned environments such as virtual machines or Kubernetes clusters, with no direct vendor access to the infrastructure.

The lightweight and open source [Distr agents](/docs/product/agents/), installed by the customer in the target environment, handle deployments and updates.
They pull application definitions and artifacts from the Distr Hub, apply customer-defined configurations,
and report deployment status, logs, and health to both the [vendor](/docs/product/vendor-portal/) and [customer](/docs/product/customer-portal/) portals,
without exposing internal infrastructure.

The Customer Portal also allows end users, who may not be involved in initial deployment, to configure applications, monitor status, access logs, and trigger updates.
This is especially useful in setups where a platform team deploys the application, but another team operates it day-to-day.

### Implementation steps

<Aside type="note">
  The agent acts only as a facilitator, pulling updates and applying them
  according to customer-defined policies. It does not provide vendor access to
  customer infrastructure.

<Steps>

{/* steps can't be indented due to prettier */}

1. Onboard Your [Application](/docs/guides/onboarding-a-helm-app/)
2. (Optional) Set Up Your [Registry](/docs/guides/container-registry/)
3. White-label the [Customer portal](/docs/product/branding/)
4. Onboard your first [customer](/docs/guides/onboarding-a-new-customer/)
5. Customer creates a [Personal Access token](/docs/integrations/personal-access-token/)
6. Customer can [deploy your application via the Dist [agents](/docs/guides/container-registry-for-end-customers/#deployment-agent-quickstart-from-the-customer-portal)

</Steps>
