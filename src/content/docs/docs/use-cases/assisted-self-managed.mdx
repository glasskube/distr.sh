The Assisted Self-Managed deployment model strikes a balance between customer control and vendor assistance. Applications run in customer-controlled infrastructure while lightweight [Distr Agents](docs/product/agents/) help manage deployments and updates. This model is ideal for organizations that want to maintain their own infrastructure while minimizing operational overhead.

Distr agents pull application definitions and artifacts from the Distr Hub, deploy them using customer-defined configurations, and report status back to the vendor and customer portals.

A key feature of the Distr agent is its ability to deploy either Docker Compose files or Helm charts that reference container images stored in the Distr registry, no additional authentication is required. The vendor provides pre-configured definition files that [automatically authenticate](/docs/guides/helm-chart-registry-auth/) and pull from the registry, making the deployment process seamless for end customers.

### Implementation steps

<Steps>
1. **Set Up Your [Registry](/docs/guides/how-to-registry/)**
2. **Onboard Your [Application](/docs/guides/onboarding-a-helm-app/)**
3. **White-label the [Customer portal](/docs/product/branding/)**
5. **Onboard your first [customer](/docs/guides/onboarding-a-new-customer/)**
6. **Customer creates a [Personal Access token](/docs/integrations/personal-access-token/)**
7. **Customer can [deploy your application via the Dist agents](/docs/guides/end-customer-registry-view/#deployment-agent-quickstart-from-the-customer-portal)**
</Steps>

  The agent acts only as a facilitator, pulling updates and applying them
  according to customer-defined policies. It does not provide vendor access to
  customer infrastructure.
