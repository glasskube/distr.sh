Assisted Self-Managed deployment strikes the balance between customer control and vendor assistance. Applications run in customer-controlled infrastructure while lightweight Distr Agents help manage deployments and updates. This model is ideal for organizations that want to maintain their own infrastructure while minimizing operational overhead.

Distr's agents pull application definitions and artifacts from the Distr Hub, deploy them according to customer-defined policies, and report status back to the vendor. Updates can be configured to require explicit customer approval, ensuring customers maintain control while benefiting from automated processes.

### Implementation steps

<Steps>
1. **Set Up Your [Registry](/docs/guides/how-to-registry/)**
2. **Onboard Your [Application](/docs/guides/onboarding-a-helm-app/)**
3. **White-label the [Customer portal](/docs/product/branding/)**
5. **Onboard your first [customer](/docs/guides/onboarding-a-new-customer/)**
6. **Customer creates a [Personal Access token](/docs/integrations/personal-access-token/)**
7. **Customer can [deploy your application via the Dist agents](/docs/guides/end-customer-registry-view/#deployment-agent-quickstart-from-the-customer-portal)**
</Steps>

  The agent acts only as a facilitator, pulling updates and applying them
  according to customer-defined policies. It does not provide vendor access to
  customer infrastructure.
