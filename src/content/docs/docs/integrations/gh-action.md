## distr-create-version

Distr offers the [distr-create-version](https://github.com/glasskube/distr-create-version) GitHub action that allows you to automatically create a new version of your application in Distr, every time you push a new release. 
It supports both Docker and Helm applications.

Please have a look at the [README.md](https://github.com/glasskube/distr-create-version/blob/main/README.md) for up-to-date docs and examples.
