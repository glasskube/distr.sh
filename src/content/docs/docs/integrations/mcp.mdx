Distr also exposes its endpoints via the [model context protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction)
to allow LLM-powered agents to interact with the Distr tools.

Common use cases include:

- Investigate which deployments are failing and why
- Update deployments, for example, as part of n8n workflows
- Interact with the Distr Platform through natural language prompts

## Getting Started With the Distr MCP Server

The Distr MCP Server is a [separate go command](https://github.com/glasskube/distr/tree/main/cmd/mcp)
that can be compiled locally.

### Build the Distr MCP Server

Make sure you have downloaded the Distr source code and have Go installed.
Then, you can build the Distr MCP Server with the following command:

```shell
make build-mcp-server
```

After compilation, the MCP server binary will be available in the `./dist/` directory.
Which can be verified with `./dist/mcp-server --help`.

### Configure the Distr MCP Server Tools

The Distr MCP Server exposes its executable functions via [tools](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/tools).

If you want to use all tools, you can extend your `mcp.json` configuration file in your MCP client:

<Aside type="note">
  Make sure to use to configure the absolute path to the `mcp-server` binary in
  the `command` section you just built above in your `mcp.json` file.
</Aside>

<Code code={mcpConfig} lang="json" title="mcp.json" />

You can also configure the optional environment variable `DISTR_HOST`
to point the MCP server against a different Distr instance.

If configured correctly, your MCP client will list the available tools:

## Interact with the Distr MCP Server

After configuring the Distr MCP Server, you can perform prompts that gather additional
information from Distr via the Distr MCP Sever.

### Get all deployments and group them by their status

    > Show me all distr deployments and group them by status.
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Response">
    Here are all distr deployments grouped by status:

    **Status: Running / OK**

    - Local: On-Prem LLM App 2 (nginx:1.27.4)
    - Local: On-Prem LLM App 2 (1.28.0)

### Investigate failed deployments

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Prompt">
    > Why do the deployments are in the status error, show the latest log.
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Response">
    Here are the deployments in error status and the reason why, including their latest log:

    **1. ACME, Inc.: Hello Distr (version 0.1.9)**

    - Reason: Missing environment variable.
    - Latest log: error while interpolating services.postgres.environment.POSTGRES_DB: required variable HELLO_DISTR_DB_NAME is missing a value: error

    **2. Pear, Inc.: On-Prem LLM App 2 (version error)**

    - Reason: Image not found.
    - Latest log: nginx Pulling nginx Error manifest for nginx:error not found: manifest unknown: manifest unknown Error response from daemon: manifest for nginx:error not found: manifest unknown: manifest unknown
