Distr exposes a RESTful JSON API that allows you to interact with the platform programmatically. 
It is the same API used by the Distr Vendor and Customer Portals.

If you prefer to interact with the API on a higher level of abstraction, you can use our [first-party SDKs](/docs/integrations/sdk) 
that handle authentication and error handling for you, and provide types.

## Base URL

Every Distr instance, no matter if self hosted or the SaaS version, exposes this API under the `/api/v1` path. 

## Authentication

To authenticate with the Distr API, you need to use a Personal Access Token. 
To create a Personal Access Token, follow the steps outlined in the [Creating a Personal Access Token](/docs/integrations/personal-access-token/) guide.

For each HTTP request to the API, you need to include the Personal Access Token in the `Authorization` header, like shown here:

```bash
curl 'https://app.distr.sh/api/v1/applications' \
  -H "Authorization: AccessToken <your-access-token-here>"
```

This will authenticate you as the user who created the Personal Access Token for the lifetime of this request. 
The token needs to be sent with every request to the API.

## Request Limits

The following limits apply to the Distr API:

- 5 requests per second
- 60 requests per minute
- 2000 requests per hour

If these limits are exceeded, the API will respond with a `429 Too Many Requests` status code.

Additionally, the API rejects request bodies larger than 1MiB.
