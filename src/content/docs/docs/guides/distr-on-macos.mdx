Distr is designed to be as versatile as possible.
That involves being able to run on a variety of operating systems successfully.
While most enterprise environments run on Linux-based VMs, there are always exceptions.
What if, for testing purposed for instance, macOS is the chosen operating system for running Distr agents?

If you're using Windows or Linux, the [Quickstart guide](/docs/getting-started/quickstart/) should cover everything you need.
But if you're setting up Distr on macOS, follow these steps to ensure a smooth deployment experience.

## Running Distr agents

<Aside type="note">
  When we talk about "running Distr," we're specifically referring to running
  the [Distr agents](/docs/product/agents/). Since Distr can also be
  self-hosted, much of this guide could apply to running Distr in a local Docker
  environment as well. However, we'll focus on the SaaS version of Distr and
  properly configuring a local macOS target environment to deploy applications
  through Distr.
</Aside>

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- A macOS system with admin access
- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) installed
- Access to the [Distr platform](https://app.distr.sh/)

### 1. Install Docker Desktop

First, install [Docker Desktop for Mac](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/mac-install/). Follow the installation instructions provided by Docker.

### 2. Verify the Docker Context

Check the local Docker context being used:

**Run:**

```shell
docker context ls
```

Expected output:

```
NAME              DESCRIPTION                               DOCKER ENDPOINT                                  ERROR
default           Current DOCKER_HOST based configuration   unix:///var/run/docker.sock
desktop-linux *   Docker Desktop                            unix:///Users/jakepage/.docker/run/docker.sock
```

<Aside type="tip">
  When Docker Desktop runs on macOS, it creates a lightweight Linux VM, and the
  `desktop-linux` context points to the Docker daemon within this VM. However,
  Distr expects to connect to the default Docker socket
  (`/var/run/docker.sock`). This mismatch can cause connectivity issues,
  especially when pulling or deploying container images. Setting the context to
  `default` aligns the Docker CLI with the expected Docker endpoint, ensuring
  Distr can interact with the Docker daemon properly.
</Aside>

If Docker is set to the `desktop-linux` context, you might encounter errors in the container logs like:

```
unable to get image 'postgres:17.3-alpine3.20': Cannot connect to the Docker daemon at unix:///Users/jakepage/.docker/run/docker.sock. Is the docker daemon running?
```

### 3. Set the Docker Context to the `default` context

To switch the Docker context to `default`, run:

```shell
docker context use default
```

Expected output:

```
NAME            DESCRIPTION                               DOCKER ENDPOINT                                  ERROR
default *       Current DOCKER_HOST based configuration   unix:///var/run/docker.sock
desktop-linux   Docker Desktop                            unix:///Users/jakepage/.docker/run/docker.sock
```

This should be all that's needed, now [test](/docs/guides/distr-on-macos/#5-test-the-setup)
your setup by creating a deployment on Distr.

### 4. Optional: Update the Docker Config File

#### When should yoo do this?

If, during installation, you encounter the following error message:

```
docker.credentials.errors.InitializationError: docker-credential-desktop not installed or not available in PATH
```

This error indicates that Docker is configured to use a credential store called "desktop",
but the corresponding executable `docker-credential-desktop` is either not installed
or not accessible through the system's PATH.

#### Why this happens

<Aside tag="info">
  When Docker is configured to use a credential store, it tries to invoke an
  external binary (docker-credential-NAME). On macOS,
  `docker-credential-osxkeychain` is generally preferred because it integrates
  well with the macOS Keychain. Using `docker-credential-desktop` can lead to
  path issues, especially if the Docker Desktop installation did not properly
  add this helper to the system's PATH.
</Aside>

#### How to fix it

1. Check your `~/.docker/config.json` and verify which `credsStore` is being used?
   ```json
   {
     "auths": {},
     "credStore": "desktop"
   }
   ```

#### Use docker-credential-osxkeychain instead.

Since you're on a Mac, you could use `docker-credential-osxkeychain` instead of `docker-credential-desktop`.

1. Install `docker-credential-helper`
   ```shell
   brew install docker-credential-helper
   ```
2. Verify `docker-credential-osxkeychain` is available.
   ```shell
   docker-credential-osxkeychain version
   docker-credential-osxkeychain (github.com/docker/docker-credential-helpers) v0.8.2
   ```
3. Set `credsStore` to `osxkeychain` in `~/.docker/config.json`
   ```json
   {
     "auths": {},
     "credStore": "osxkeychain"
   }
   ```
4. Login to Docker Hub
   ```shell
   docker login -u $USER
   Password:
   Login Succeeded
   ```

### 5. Test the Setup

To verify everything is configured correctly, try
[deploying an application](/docs/guides/onboarding-a-docker-app/#creating-a-new-deployment)
through Distr. If there are no errors related to Docker socket access, your setup is good to go.

With these steps, your macOS environment should be fully configured to run Distr agents without issues.
