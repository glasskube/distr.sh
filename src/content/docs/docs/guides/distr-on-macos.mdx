Distr is designed to be as versatile as possible. That involves being able to run on a variety of operating systems successfully. While most enterprise environments run on Linux-based VMs, there are always exceptions. What if, for testing purposed for instance, macOS is the chosen operating system for running Distr agents?

If you're using Windows or Linux, the [Quickstart guide](/docs/getting-started/quickstart/) should cover everything you need. But if you're setting up Distr on macOS, follow these steps to ensure a smooth deployment experience.

## Running Distr agents

<Aside type="note">
  When we talk about "running Distr," we're specifically referring to running
  the [Distr agents](/docs/product/agents/). Since Distr can also be
  self-hosted, much of this guide could apply to running Distr in a local Docker
  environment as well. However, we'll focus on the SaaS version of Distr and
  properly configuring a local MacOS target environment to deploy applications
  through Distr.
</Aside>

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- A macOS system with admin access
- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) installed
- Access to the [Distr platform](https://app.distr.sh/)

## 1. Install Docker Desktop

First, install [Docker Desktop for Mac](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/mac-install/). Follow the installation instructions provided by Docker.

### 1.1 Delete Distr volume on Docker Desktop

<Aside type="note">
  If you've already tried to install Distr on Docker Desktop and failed to
  deploy an application, a volume named `distr_scratch` has been created. This
  volume is used to store the Distr agent's data. If it exists, you need to
  delete it.
</Aside>

Delete the volume, run:

```sh
docker volume rm distr_scratch
```

## 2. Verify the Docker Context

<Aside type="caution">
  When Docker Desktop runs on macOS, it creates a lightweight Linux VM, and the
  `desktop-linux` context points to the Docker daemon within this VM. However,
  Distr expects to connect to the default Docker socket
  (`/var/run/docker.sock`). This mismatch can cause connectivity issues,
  especially when pulling or deploying container images. Setting the context to
  `default` aligns the Docker CLI with the expected Docker endpoint, ensuring
  Distr can interact with the Docker daemon properly.
</Aside>

Check the current Docker context, run:

```sh
docker context ls
```

Expected output:

```sh
NAME              DESCRIPTION                               DOCKER ENDPOINT                                  ERROR
default           Current DOCKER_HOST based configuration   unix:///var/run/docker.sock
desktop-linux *   Docker Desktop                            unix:///Users/jakepage/.docker/run/docker.sock
```

If Docker is set to the `desktop-linux` context, you might encounter errors in the container logs like:

```sh
unable to get image 'postgres:17.3-alpine3.20': Cannot connect to the Docker daemon at unix:///Users/jakepage/.docker/run/docker.sock. Is the docker daemon running?
```

## 3. Set the Docker Context to `default`

To switch the Docker context to `default`, run:

```sh
docker context use default
```

Expected output:

```sh
NAME            DESCRIPTION                               DOCKER ENDPOINT                                  ERROR
default *       Current DOCKER_HOST based configuration   unix:///var/run/docker.sock
desktop-linux   Docker Desktop                            unix:///Users/jakepage/.docker/run/docker.sock
```

## 4. Update the Docker Config File

If you're using the Distr agent on macOS, note that it does not rely on Docker's credential store (`credStore`). Having this setting in your Docker configuration can sometimes cause authentication issues. To prevent potential errors, it's best to remove the `credStore` entry from the Docker config file entirely.

#### How to fix it

1. **Check your current Docker config file**

   Run the following command to inspect your configuration:

   ```sh
   cat ~/.docker/config.json
   ```

   If you see an entry like this:

   ```json
   {
     "auths": {},
     "credStore": "desktop"
   }
   ```

   You'll need to remove the `credStore` line.

2. **Open the config file in a text editor**

   Use `nano` to edit the Docker configuration:

   ```sh
   nano ~/.docker/config.json
   ```

3. **Remove the `credStore` line**

   Inside the file, find the line that contains:

   ```json
   "credStore": "desktop"
   ```

   Delete this line entirely, ensuring you don't leave a trailing comma that could cause JSON parsing errors.

   After editing, your file should look something like this:

   ```json
   {
     "auths": {}
   }
   ```

4. **Save the file**

   - **Press `CTRL + X`** to exit.
   - **Press `Y`** to confirm saving the changes.
   - **Press `Enter`** to save with the same filename.

5. **Verify the change**

   Run:

   ```sh
   cat ~/.docker/config.json
   ```

   Ensure that the `credStore` line is no longer present.

Removing the `credStore` setting ensures that the Distr agent operates without credential store conflicts, reducing potential authentication issues.

## 6. Test the Setup

To verify everything is configured correctly, try [deploying an application](/docs/guides/onboarding-a-docker-app/#creating-a-new-deployment) through Distr. If there are no errors related to Docker socket access, your setup is good to go.

With these steps, your MacOS environment should be fully configured to run Distr agents without issues. If you encounter any problems, feel free to reach out to us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/6qqBSAWZfW) or via email at support@glasskube.com.
