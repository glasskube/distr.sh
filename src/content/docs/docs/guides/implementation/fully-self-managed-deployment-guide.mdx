This guide provides practical steps for implementing the Fully Self-Managed deployment model, where customers maintain complete control over their infrastructure and deployment processes.

## Prerequisites

Before implementing this model, ensure you have:

- An active Distr account with vendor access
- Software packaged as Docker images or Helm charts
- Documentation ready for customer self-deployment

## Solution Architecture

## Implementation Process

<Steps>
1. **Set Up Your Registry**
2. **Onboard Your Application**
3. **Create Customer-Specific Credentials**
4. **Prepare Customer Documentation**
5. **Customer Onboarding Process**
6. **Establish Update Workflow**
</Steps>

### 1. Set Up Your Registry

Configure your Distr Registry to host and manage your application artifacts:
   
- Navigate to the Registry section in Distr Hub
- Configure your artifact storage settings
- Set up versioning policies and retention rules
- Configure access controls for specific customers

### 2. Onboard Your Application

Prepare your application for distribution through the registry:
   
<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Docker Application">
- Package your application as Docker images
- Create a Docker Compose template
- Document environment variables and configuration options
- [Follow the Docker application onboarding guide](/docs/guides/platform-management/onboarding-a-docker-app/)
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Kubernetes Application">
- Package your application as Helm charts
- Document Helm values and configuration options
- Test chart installation with different configurations
- [Follow the Helm application onboarding guide](/docs/guides/platform-management/onboarding-a-helm-app/)
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### 3. Create Customer-Specific Credentials

Generate unique credentials for each customer to access your registry:
   
- Navigate to the Customers section
- [Add a new customer](docs/guides/platform-management/onboarding-a-new-customer/) or select an existing one
- Generate registry credentials
- Configure license and entitlement settings

### 4. Prepare Customer Documentation

Create clear documentation for your customers, including:
   
- Registry access instructions
- Authentication procedures
- Artifact download steps
- Deployment instructions for your application
- Upgrade procedures
- Troubleshooting guidance

### 5. Customer Onboarding Process

Guide your customer through the initial setup:
   
- Provide the customer with their registry credentials
- Walk them through accessing the registry
- Assist with the initial artifact download
- Support the first deployment as needed
- Verify successful deployment

### 6. Establish Update Workflow

Create a process for delivering updates to self-managed customers:
   
- Define your release notification process
- Document the update procedure for customers
- Create a channel for update-related questions
- Establish verification procedures for successful updates

## Registry Access Methods

For fully self-managed customers, you'll need to provide clear instructions on accessing your registry. This typically involves:

### Docker Registry Access

```bash
# Login to the registry
docker login registry.yourdomain.distr.sh -u customer-username -p customer-token

# Pull an image
docker pull registry.yourdomain.distr.sh/your-application:version
```

### Helm Registry Access

```bash
# Add the Helm repository
helm repo add your-repo https://registry.yourdomain.distr.sh/helm/customer-name --username customer-username --password customer-token

# Update repositories
helm repo update

# Install a chart
helm install your-application your-repo/your-application --version 1.0.0
```

## Monitoring Usage

Even with fully self-managed deployments, Distr provides visibility into:

- Which artifacts customers have downloaded
- When downloads occurred
- Which versions are being used
- License compliance status

Access this information from the Analytics section in your Distr Hub dashboard.

  Consider creating customer-specific packages with pre-configured connection

</Aside>

## Best Practices

- Maintain detailed release notes for each version
- Establish a regular communication channel for updates
- Create clear rollback procedures for customers
- Provide offline documentation in case customers can't access your support portal
- Consider offering installation validation services where customers can share logs for verification

## Next Steps

After implementing the Fully Self-Managed model, you might want to:

- [Configure license management](/docs/guides/license-mgmt/) for more granular control
- [Set up customer-specific artifact repositories](/docs/product/vendor-portal/#customer-specific-repositories)
- [Implement usage analytics](/docs/product/vendor-portal/#analytics) to track adoption
