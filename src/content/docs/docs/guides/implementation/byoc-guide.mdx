This guide provides practical steps for implementing the Bring Your Own Cloud (BYOC) deployment model, where you deploy and manage both infrastructure and applications in customer-owned environments.

## Prerequisites

Before implementing this model, ensure you have:

- An active Distr account with vendor access
- Software packaged a Docker images or Helm charts
- Infrastructure requirements defined (for Terraform modules)
- Customer cloud account access permissions defined

## Solution Architecture

## Implementation Process

<Steps>
1. **Set Up Your Registry**
2. **Onboard Your Application**
3. **Create Infrastructure Modules**
4. **Configure Agent Settings**
5. **Customer Cloud Access Setup**
6. **Customer Onboarding Process**
7. **Infrastructure Deployment**
8. **Application Deployment**
9. **Establish Management Workflow**
</Steps>

### 1. Set Up Your Registry

Configure your Distr Registry for both application and infrastructure artifacts:

- Navigate to the Registry section in Distr Hub
- Configure your artifact storage settings
- Set up separate repositories for applications and infrastructure modules
- Configure access controls for specific customers

### 2. Onboard Your Application

Prepare your application for deployment:

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Docker Application">
- Package your application as Docker images
- Create a Docker Compose template
- Define default configurations
- [Follow the Docker application onboarding guide](/docs/guides/platform-management/onboarding-a-docker-app/)
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Kubernetes Application">
- Package your application as Helm charts
- Define default values
- Configure deployment parameters
- [Follow the Helm application onboarding guide](/docs/guides/platform-management/onboarding-a-helm-app/)
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### 3. Create Infrastructure Modules

<Aside type="note">
  The Terraform agent capabilities are coming soon. This section outlines the
  approach for when this feature is available.
</Aside>

Define infrastructure modules for your application:

- Create Terraform modules for required infrastructure
- Define variables for customer-specific configurations
- Include security best practices in your modules
- Package modules for the Distr Registry
- Test modules in different cloud environments

### 4. Configure Agent Settings

Prepare advanced deployment agent configurations:

- Navigate to the Agents section in Distr Hub
- Configure agent permissions for full management capabilities
- Set up automated update scheduling
- Configure infrastructure provisioning permissions
- Define monitoring and alerting parameters

### 5. Customer Cloud Access Setup

Work with your customer to establish appropriate access:

- Define the required permissions in their cloud environment
- Create service accounts or roles with appropriate permissions
- Document security boundaries and access limitations
- Establish audit logging for all operations
- Create a permissions document for customer security teams

### 6. Customer Onboarding Process

Guide your customer through the initial setup:

- Create customer credentials in Distr Hub
- Configure cloud provider credentials securely
- Generate agent installation tokens
- Assist with initial agent deployment
- Verify agent connectivity and permissions

### 7. Infrastructure Deployment

Deploy the required infrastructure:

- Use the Terraform agent to provision infrastructure
- Verify resource creation and configuration
- Document created resources for customer reference
- Establish infrastructure monitoring
- Create infrastructure runbooks for common scenarios

### 8. Application Deployment

Deploy the application on the provisioned infrastructure:

- Configure application for the specific environment
- Deploy through the appropriate agent (Docker or Helm)
- Verify successful deployment
- Set up application monitoring
- Establish backup and disaster recovery procedures

### 9. Establish Management Workflow

Create processes for ongoing management:

- Define update procedures and schedules
- Document infrastructure scaling procedures
- Create incident response protocols
- Establish regular maintenance windows
- Define communication procedures for planned changes

## Management Console Access

For BYOC deployments, you'll have a comprehensive management console in Distr Hub that allows you to:

- Monitor all customer deployments in one place
- View infrastructure and application health
- Manage versions and updates
- Schedule maintenance activities
- Track resource usage and performance

<Aside type="tip">
  Consider creating role-based access to the management console for different
  team members (support, operations, engineering) with appropriate permissions.
</Aside>

## Push-Based Update Model

With BYOC deployments, you can implement a push-based update model:

1. Test new versions in your environment
2. Schedule updates for customer environments
3. Apply updates automatically or during maintenance windows
4. Monitor deployment success across all customers
5. Roll back automatically if issues are detected

## Infrastructure Management

When the Terraform agent becomes available, you'll be able to:

- Store Terraform modules in the Distr Registry
- Version and manage infrastructure as code
- Apply infrastructure updates to customer environments
- Track infrastructure state securely
- Provide infrastructure metrics to both you and customers

## Best Practices

- Clearly document all managed resources
- Implement infrastructure changes through code only
- Use least-privilege permissions for agent operations
- Create comprehensive monitoring for both infrastructure and applications
- Establish clear boundaries of responsibility with customers
- Maintain detailed change logs for all operations

## Next Steps

After implementing the BYOC model, you might want to:

- [Set up advanced monitoring](/docs/product/vendor-portal/#monitoring) for the full stack
- [Implement cost optimization](/docs/product/vendor-portal/#cost-optimization) for customer environments
- [Create custom dashboards](/docs/product/vendor-portal/#custom-dashboards) for different stakeholders
