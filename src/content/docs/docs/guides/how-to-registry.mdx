A quick guide to configuring and using the Distr Artifact Registry for secure, tag-based software distribution.

## 1. Set your Registry Slug

Before you can push or pull artifacts, you must configure a registry slug at the organization level. This slug becomes part of your registry URL.

  darkSrc="/src/assets/docs/product/registry/dark-slug.png"
  alt="Registry slug configuration"
/>

<Aside type="note">
  The slug must start with a lowercase letter or digit and can only contain
  lowercase letters, digits, `.`, `_`, `__`, or `-`.

## 2. Authenticate with a Personal Access Token

Generate a [Personal Access Token (PAT)](/docs/integrations/personal-access-token/) in your Distr account. Use this token to log in to the registry:

```bash
echo "YOUR-ACCESS-TOKEN" | docker login registry.distr.sh:8585 --password-stdin -u -
```

<Aside type="tip">
  No username is required, the PAT is linked directly to your user account.
</Aside>

## 3. Push Your First Artifact

Tag and push your Docker image (or other OCI artifact) to your registry:

```bash
docker pull hello-world
docker tag hello-world registry.distr.sh/slug/hello-world:1.0.0
docker push registry.distr.sh/slug/hello-world:1.0.0
```

## 4. Control Artifact Access through Licensing

- Assign licenses to customers to control which artifacts and tags they can access.
- Licenses can be scoped to all tags, specific tags, or a single tag.
- Licenses can have expiration dates or remain valid indefinitely.

## 5. Monitor Usage

- Use the Distr dashboard to view artifact pull counts, customer usage, and download analytics.
- Use the Downloads panel to view a chronological list of all downloaded artifacts, including which user downloaded them and from which IP address.
- The registry only supports immutable tags, once pushed, a tag cannot be changed.

  darkSrc="/src/assets/docs/product/registry/dashboard-artifact-view-dark.png"
  alt="Registry artifacts view"
/>

## 6. Customer Access

- Customers should authenticate with their own [PAT](/docs/integrations/personal-access-token/) and can only pull artifacts they are licensed for.
- The customer portal provides a simplified view, showing only accessible artifacts and versions.

  darkSrc="/src/assets/docs/product/registry/customer-artifact-view-dark.png"
  alt="Registry artifacts view"
