A quick guide to configuring and using the Distr Artifact Registry for secure, tag-based software distribution.

## 1. Set your Registry Slug

Before you can push or pull artifacts, you must configure a registry slug at the organization level. This slug becomes part of your registry URL.

<ThemedImage
  lightSrc={lightSlug}
  darkSrc={darkSlug}
  alt="Registry slug configuration"
/>

<Aside type="note">
  The slug must start with a lowercase letter or digit and can only contain
  lowercase letters, digits, `.`, `_`, `__`, or `-`.
</Aside>

## 2. Authenticate with a Personal Access Token

Generate a [Personal Access Token (PAT)](/docs/integrations/personal-access-token/) in your Distr account. Use this token to log in to the registry:

```bash
echo "YOUR-ACCESS-TOKEN" | docker login registry.distr.sh:8585 --password-stdin -u -
```

<Aside type="tip">
  No username is required, the PAT is linked directly to your user account.
</Aside>

## 3. Push Your First Artifact

Now that you're authenticated, you can start pushing artifacts to the registry.

Before uploading, you need to tag your artifact using the correct registry slug and version.

You can try it with a sample image:

```bash
docker pull hello-world
docker tag hello-world registry.distr.sh/slug/hello-world:1.0.0
docker push registry.distr.sh/slug/hello-world:1.0.0
```

Replace slug with your configured registry slug, and 1.0.0 with your desired version tag.

## 4. Monitor Usage

- Use the Distr dashboard to view artifact pull counts, customer usage, and download analytics.
- Use the Downloads panel to view a chronological list of all downloaded artifacts, including which user downloaded them and from which IP address.
- The registry only supports immutable tags, once pushed, a tag cannot be changed.

<ThemedImage
  lightSrc={dashboardArtifactViewLight}
  darkSrc={dashboardArtifactViewDark}
  alt="Registry artifacts view"
/>

## 5. Customer Access

- Customers should authenticate with their own [PAT](/docs/integrations/personal-access-token/) and can only pull artifacts they are licensed for.
- The [customer portal](/docs/guides/container-registry-for-end-customers/#registry-quickstart-from-the-customer-portal) provides a simplified view, the registry UI only shows the artifacts and versions that are accessible to the user.

<ThemedImage
  lightSrc={customerArtifactViewLight}
  darkSrc={customerArtifactViewDark}
  alt="Registry artifacts view"
/>
