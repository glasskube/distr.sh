Distr allows users to define environment variable templates for Docker applications.
Users can configure and customize environment variables before deploying an application.

In this guide, builds on top the [onboard a Docker application](/docs/guides/onboarding-a-docker-app/) and explains the
environment variable templates in more detail.

# What is an Environment Variable Template?

Environment variables are used to pass deployment specific values to your application.
With Distr, you can define a template for these variables, allowing users to customize them before deployment and ensuring all necessary values are set.

This setup consists of three parts:

1. A **parameterized Docker Compose file** that references dynamic variables.
2. A **template file** that provides default values for those variables, allowing end users to modify them in Distr before deployment.
3. The actual **environment** configured during the deployment of the application.

<Aside type="caution">
  It is important to note that updating the environment template will not update
  the environment file for existing deployments. Existing deployments will need
  to add the new variables manually when they release a new version.
</Aside>

Hereâ€™s an example of how it works:

<Aside type="tip">
  Using `:?error` ensures that the template variable must be set, else it will
  not start
</Aside>

The docker compose file will be the same for all deployments that use that specific version of the application.
The environment file can be kustomize for each deployment

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="docker-compose.yaml">
    <Code code={dockerComposeBasic} lang="yaml" />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label=".env">
    <Code code={envBasic} lang="dotenv" />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

You can execute this example with the following command:

```shell
docker compose up --env .env
```

# Referencing environment variables in multiple services

<Aside type="caution">
  As the Distr agent **does not** mount the `.env` file as file into the
  containers, but provides the variables separately, so you have fine control
  over which service is able to access which env variable.
</Aside>

You need to pass the environment variables to the services in the `docker-compose.yaml` file.

If multiple services need the same environment variables, you can define them in `x-` sections of the `docker-compose.yaml` file.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="docker-compose.yaml">
    <Code code={dockerComposeMultiService} lang="yaml" />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label=".env">
    <Code code={envMultiService} lang="dotenv" />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

You can execute this example with the following command:

```shell
docker compose up --env .env
```

When running the docker compose file you will be able to see following output for the webservers `/env` endpoint:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="service one">
    <Code
      code={oneJson}
      lang="json"
      title="http://localhost:3001/env"
      frame="terminal"
    />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="service two">
    <Code
      code={twoJson}
      lang="json"
      title="http://localhost:3002/env"
      frame="terminal"
    />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="service three">
    <Code
      code={threeJson}
      lang="json"
      title="http://localhost:3003/env"
      frame="terminal"
    />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
