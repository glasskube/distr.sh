Distr is an open source software distribution platform built for multiple [deployment scenarios](/docs/use-cases/fully-self-managed/). It enables software and AI companies to distribute applications and artifacts to self-managed environments.

Distr provides distribution tooling for [self-managed](/docs/use-cases/fully-self-managed/), [BYOC](/docs/use-cases/byoc-bring-your-own-cloud/), [air-gapped](/docs/use-cases/air-gapped/),
and [edge deployments](/docs/use-cases/edge-deployments/) while giving vendors visibility and control throughout the application lifecycle.
