Distr offers flexible subscription plans designed to match your distribution journey. Understanding which plan fits your current needs will help you get the most value from the platform.

<Aside type="tip">
  All new organizations start with a **30-day Pro Trial** - giving you full
  access to Pro features to evaluate Distr. Learn more in our [trial
  guide](/docs/free-trial/).

## Starter Plan

**Choose Starter if you're validating customer-install GTM for the first time.**

The Starter plan is perfect for teams testing the distribution flow with a small number of customers. Usually, this is one internal champion testing the flow. Agent-based installs and Docker make setup extremely fast — you ship updates quickly, iterate rapidly, and customers get the newest version immediately.

**Ideal for:**

- Fast learning and proving distribution works before scaling
- Testing your first customer installations
- Validating your self-hosted distribution strategy
- Small teams with 1-3 customer deployments

**Key characteristics:**

- Up to 3 customer organizations
- 1 deployment per customer
- Focus on speed and simplicity
- All users have admin privileges (no role management)

## Pro Plan

**Choose Pro once you're past POC and rolling out to multiple customers.**

Platform/DevOps teams typically take over here. If scalability is important, deployments move to Kubernetes/Helm or Artifact-based distribution. Focus shifts from pure speed to control: version visibility, license enforcement, SSO/RBAC access control across both your team and your customers' teams.

**Ideal for:**

- Rolling out to multiple customers
- Teams that need license management and version control
- Organizations requiring role-based access control
- Companies needing SSO integration
- Teams that want white-label customer portals

**Key characteristics:**

- Up to 100 customer organizations
- 3 deployments per customer
- License management for version control
- Role-based access control (Admin, Default, Read-Only)
- Single Sign-On (SSO) support
- White-label Distr

<Aside type="tip">
  Pro includes white glove onboarding to help you get started quickly with
  advanced features like license management and RBAC.

## Enterprise Plan

**Choose Enterprise when Distr becomes your entire commercial self-hosted delivery suite.**

You're not just distributing software anymore — but also documentation, support portals, public images, automated workflows, dynamic licensing, usage-based billing and more — all inside one platform.

**Ideal for:**

- Organizations using Distr as their complete commercial platform
- Companies needing unlimited scale
- Teams requiring dedicated infrastructure
- Organizations needing advanced features like License SDK, dynamic licensing, and customer billing
- Companies requiring SLA guarantees and dedicated support

**Key characteristics:**

- Unlimited customer organizations, deployments, and users
- Advanced features: License SDK, dynamic license management, customer billing
- Custom roles and workflows
- Documentation pages, wiki, and ticket system
- Public registry and CVE scanning
- Dedicated support engineer and SLA
