All new Distr organizations automatically receive a **30-day Pro Trial**, giving you full access to Pro features to evaluate the platform without requiring a credit card.

## How Trials Work

When you create a new Distr organization, you automatically receive a **30-day Pro Trial**:

1. **Full Feature Access** - You have access to all Pro features during the trial period
2. **No Credit Card Required** - Start using Distr immediately without payment
3. **Trial Banner** - A banner at the top of the Vendor Portal displays your trial end date
4. **Trial Expiration** - Your trial expires 30 days after organization creation

<Aside type="tip">
  During your trial period, you'll see a banner at the top of the Vendor Portal
  showing your trial end date. Make sure to select a subscription plan before
  your trial expires to avoid service interruption.
</Aside>

## What Happens When Your Trial Expires

If you haven't selected a subscription plan before your trial expires:

1. **Service Access** - You'll be redirected to the subscription selection page
2. **Feature Access** - Pro features become unavailable until you select a subscription
3. **Data Retention** - Your data, customers, and deployments remain intact
4. **No Automatic Charges** - You won't be charged until you actively select a subscription plan

<Aside type="caution">
  Admin users will see subscription management options. Non-admin users will see
  a message explaining that subscription management requires admin privileges.
  Make sure at least one admin user selects a subscription before the trial
  expires.
</Aside>

## Selecting a Subscription During Trial

You can select a subscription plan at any time during your trial:

1. Navigate to the **Subscription** section in the Vendor Portal sidebar
2. Review available plans (Starter, Pro, Enterprise)
3. Select your preferred plan
4. Complete checkout via Stripe
5. Your subscription becomes active immediately

<Aside type="tip">
  If you select a subscription before your trial expires, your subscription
  period begins immediately. You won't lose any trial time - your paid
  subscription starts right away.
</Aside>

## Choosing the Right Plan

Not sure which plan to choose? Consider:

- **Starter** - If you're validating your first POCs and testing with 1-3 customers
- **Pro** - If you're rolling out to multiple customers and need license management and RBAC
- **Enterprise** - If Distr is your complete commercial platform with unlimited scale needs
