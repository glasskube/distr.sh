## Getting Started with Platform Tutorials

The fastest way to learn how to use Distr is through the interactive tutorials available directly on the platform. When you first create an account, you'll have access to three guided tutorials that cover the core capabilities:

  darkSrc="/src/assets/docs/getting-started/quickstart/tutorials-dark.png"
  alt="Fully-Self-Managed diagram"
/>

### 1. Artifact Registry

This tutorial walks you through setting up your organization's registry slug, creating a personal access token and logging in, pushing and pulling artifacts from your own private artifact registry.

### 2. Agents, Application and Deployments Tutorial

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to download and install the Distr agent, deploy a sample hello-distr application, verify and monitor deployment statuses, and automate future releases.

### 3. Invite your first customer Tutorial

This tutorial guides you through setting up your Customer Portal and inviting a customer. You'll learn how to customize the portal name and welcome page with helpful instructions and release notes, send the customer invite email, and preview the portal from the end customer's perspective.

## Accessing the Tutorials

To access these tutorials:

1. Create your **free** [Distr account](https://app.distr.sh/login)
2. Navigate to the Dashboard
3. Go to the Tutorials section
4. We recommend completing the tutorials in order for the best learning experience


## After Completing Tutorials

Upon completion, you'll be ready to:

1. **Onboard Your Own Applications:** Add your [Docker Compose](/docs/guides/platform-management/onboarding-a-docker-app/) or [Helm chart-based applications](/docs/guides/platform-management/onboarding-a-helm-app/) to Distr
2. **Push Your Commercial Artifacts:** Upload your artifacts to your private registry
3. **Invite Customers:** Invite new [customers](docs/guides/platform-management/onboarding-a-new-customer/) into your organization

### Next, explore the Use cases section

Visit the [Use cases](/docs/use-cases/fully-self-managed/) section to identify the scenario that best fits your end customers and begin implementing the most appropriate deployment model for them.
