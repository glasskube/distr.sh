## Prerequisites

If you're ready to distribute your own application with Distr, it should be:

- **Containerized** (Docker or Helm)
- Using **consistent versioning**
- Have **standardized dependencies**

For more details on preparing your application, see our [self-managed readiness guide](https://glasskube.dev/white-paper/building-blocks/).

<Aside type="tip">
  Don't have an application ready? No problem! You can follow the tutorials and
  ship a sample app to learn the platform. Distr provides test applications that
  let you explore all features without setting up your own app first.

## Getting Started with Platform Tutorials

The fastest way to learn Distr is through the interactive tutorials available directly on the platform. When you first create an account, you'll have access to three guided tutorials that cover the core capabilities:

### 1. Artifact Registry

This tutorial walks you through setting up your organization's registry slug, creating a personal access token and logging in, and pushing and pulling artifacts.

### 2. Agents, Application and Deployments Tutorial

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to download and install the Distr agent, deploy a sample hello-distr application, verify and monitor deployment statuses, and automate future releases.

### 3. Invite your first customer Tutorial

This tutorial guides you through setting up your Customer Portal and inviting a customer. You'll learn how to customize the portal name and welcome page with helpful instructions and release notes, send the customer invite email, and preview the portal from the end customer's perspective.

## Accessing the Tutorials

To access these tutorials:

1. Create your **free** [Distr account](https://app.distr.sh/login)
2. Navigate to the Dashboard
3. Go to the Tutorials section
4. We recommend completing the tutorials in order for the best learning experience


## After Completing Tutorials

Upon completion, you'll be ready to:

1. **Onboard Your Own Applications:** Add your [Docker Compose](/docs/guides/platform-management/onboarding-a-docker-app/) or [Helm chart-based applications](/docs/guides/platform-management/onboarding-a-helm-app/) to Distr
2. **Push Your Commercial Artifacts:** Upload your artifacts to your private registry
3. **Invite Customers:** Invite new [customers](docs/guides/platform-management/onboarding-a-new-customer/) into your organization
4. **Create Deployments:** Set up application deployments across different environments
5. **Manage Licenses:** Use application [licenses](/docs/guides/platform-management/license-mgmt/) to control access at the application and version level, and artifact licenses to grant access to specific artifact tags.

### Next, explore the Implementation Guides

Head over to the [Implementation guides](/docs/guides/implementation/fully-self-managed-deployment-guide/) to start implementing the deployment model that best fits your end customerâ€™s needs.
