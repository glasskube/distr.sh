- Unlimited deployments
- Helm, Docker, and Terraform agents _(Terraform coming soon)_
- Private registry (100GB)
- GitHub integration
- Live metrics & logs (no retention)
- Distr API access
- Immediate access to new features

<Aside type="tip">
  Get started immediately by creating your free Distr account
  [here](https://signup.distr.sh) and following the [onboarding
  tutorials](/docs/getting-started/quickstart/#getting-started-with-platform-tutorials).

## Self-Managed

Best for teams with the highest compliancy needs:

- Deploy in your own cloud or on-prem
- Full control over versioning and availability
- Same features as SaaS
- Ideal for data-sensitive or regulated environments
- Experience using Distr for self-managing your own Distr deployment
