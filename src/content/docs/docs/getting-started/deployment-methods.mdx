## Deployment Methods

As an Open Source platform, Distr offers two deployment methods to suit different organizational needs:

### SaaS (Hosted by Distr)

The fastest way to get started. Our fully hosted offering includes:

All in the free tier:
- Up to 3 users
- Basic license management
- Unlimited deployments
- Helm, Docker, and Terraform agents (Terraform coming soon)
- Private registry (100â€¯GB)
- GitHub integration
- Live metrics & logs (OpenTelemetry-compatible, no retention)
- Distr API access
- Immediate access to new features

To check view the other plans go to the [pricing page here](https://glasskube.dev/pricing/).

<Aside type="tip">
  Get started immediately by creating your free Distr account
  [here](https://signup.distr.sh) and following the [onboarding tutorials](/docs/getting-started/quickstart/#getting-started-with-platform-tutorials).

### Self-Hosted

Best for teams with compliance or infrastructure needs:

- Deploy in your own cloud or on-prem
- Full control over versioning and availability
- Same features as SaaS
- Ideal for data-sensitive or regulated environments

<Aside type="note">
  Self-hosted deployments use the same semantic versioning as our SaaS offering,
  making it easy to stay up-to-date with the latest features. For setup
  instructions, see our [Self-Hosting
  Guide](/docs/self-hosting/getting-started).
