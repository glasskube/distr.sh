## Deployment Methods

As an Open Source platform, Distr offers two deployment methods to suit different organizational needs:

### SaaS (Hosted by Distr)
The fastest way to get started is with our fully-managed SaaS offering:
- **Maximum flexibility** with immediate access to the latest features and updates
- Simplified upgrade paths with zero maintenance overhead
- Support for unlimited applications and customers
- Single Sign-On (SSO) integration capabilities
- Advanced credentials encryption for enhanced security
- Enterprise-grade reliability with no platform management responsibilities
- Flexible pricing based on usage

<Aside type="tip">
  Get started immediately by creating your Distr account [here](https://signup.distr.sh) and following the onboarding tutorials.

### Self-Hosted
For organizations with specific compliance requirements or those who prefer to manage their own infrastructure:
- Complete control over your deployment and version management
- Deploy in your own cloud account or on-premises infrastructure
- OCI-compatible container images for easy deployment and scaling
- Full responsibility for platform availability and maintenance
- Same features and capabilities as the SaaS offering
- Ideal for users with strict data locality or compliance requirements

<Aside type="note">
  Self-hosted deployments use the same semantic versioning as our SaaS offering, making it easy to stay up-to-date with the latest features. For setup instructions, see our [Self-Hosting Guide](/docs/self-hosting/getting-started).
