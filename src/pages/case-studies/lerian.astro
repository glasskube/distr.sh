  challenge: `<a href="https://lerian.studio" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lerian</a> provides banking and financial infrastructure solutions that need to run in highly regulated, secure environments. Their customers in the financial sector require on-premises deployments with strict compliance, data protection, and security standards. Traditional deployment approaches created significant operational friction: manual installations, complex update procedures, error-prone rollbacks, and limited visibility into system health across multiple customer environments.

"<strong>In the financial sector, infrastructure shouldn't be a barrier to innovation,</strong>" explains Jefferson Rodrigues, Co-Founder & CTO at Lerian. "<strong>Our customers need the same speed and agility of cloud-native deployments, but within their own Kubernetes environments. We were spending too much time on operational overhead—manual deployments, coordinating updates with customer IT teams, and troubleshooting issues without proper visibility.</strong>"

The team needed a solution that would:

<ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 my-4">
  <li>Enable standardized, repeatable deployments across multiple customer environments</li>
  <li>Provide real-time visibility into deployment status and application health</li>
  <li>Support instant rollbacks when issues occurred</li>
  <li>Maintain complete traceability for compliance and audit requirements</li>
  <li>Reduce the operational burden on both Lerian's team and their customers' DevOps teams</li>
</ul>`,

  solution: `Lerian adopted Distr to power their Lifecycle Management platform, transforming how they distribute and manage applications in customer-controlled Kubernetes environments. By building on Distr's open-source foundation, Lerian created a comprehensive lifecycle management system that handles installations, updates, rollbacks, and monitoring—all while maintaining the security and control their financial services customers require.

<strong>Key implementation highlights:</strong>

<ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 my-4">
  <li><strong>Bring Your Own Cluster (BYOC) deployments:</strong> Customers run Lerian services in their own Kubernetes environments, meeting strict compliance requirements while leveraging standardized deployment workflows</li>
  <li><strong>Declarative deployments with versioned templates:</strong> All installations are predictable, fully traceable operations using Helm charts and OCI images, eliminating the inefficiency of manual scripts</li>
  <li><strong>Integrated monitoring dashboard:</strong> Real-time visibility into deployed versions, application health, container logs, and agent status—providing 100% visibility for internal teams without compromising customer autonomy</li>
  <li><strong>One-click rollbacks:</strong> Instant reversion to previous versions with automatic rollback in seconds, dramatically reducing Mean Time To Recovery (MTTR) and eliminating long investigation windows</li>
  <li><strong>Token-protected distribution:</strong> Secure access to Helm repositories and OCI images ensures deployment integrity across all customer environments</li>
</ul>

By leveraging Distr's infrastructure, Lerian can focus on their core banking and financial services features while providing enterprise-grade deployment capabilities. Their <a href="https://docs.lerian.studio/en/lifecycle-management" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">comprehensive documentation</a> demonstrates how customers can deploy, update, and manage Lerian services with the same ease as SaaS products—while maintaining complete control over their infrastructure.`,

  result: `Lerian's Lifecycle Management platform, powered by Distr, has transformed their operational efficiency and customer experience:

<ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 my-4">
  <li><strong>Smoother internal operations:</strong> Standardized deployments mean any squad can deploy new versions without opening tickets, validating features in staging with full traceability</li>
  <li><strong>Faster development cycles:</strong> Execution teams gained more control and autonomy, accelerating the entire development lifecycle</li>
  <li><strong>Reduced operational load:</strong> DevOps teams at both Lerian and their customers spend significantly less time on deployment coordination and troubleshooting</li>
  <li><strong>100% guaranteed traceability:</strong> All changes are versioned and visually organized, bringing governance to operations and improving collaboration across engineering, product, and ops teams</li>
  <li><strong>Elimination of deployment risks:</strong> Automatic rollback capabilities reduce recovery time from hours or days to seconds</li>
</ul>

The solution has proven particularly valuable in the financial sector, where Lerian operates. Banking, messaging, and latency-sensitive services require precision, control, and efficiency in managing distributed applications. By adopting Distr, Lerian ensures infrastructure is no longer a barrier to innovation—instead, it's an enabler.

Today, Lerian's customers benefit from the transparency, control, and collaboration that comes with open-source solutions, aligned with Lerian's philosophy of building trustworthy financial infrastructure.
